Non compact continuum limit of two coupled Potts models,  We study two  Q  state Potts models coupled by the product of their energy operators  in the regime      Q  le    where the coupling is relevant  A particular choice of weights on the square lattice is shown to be equivalent to the integrable  a          vertex model  It corresponds to a selfdual system of two antiferromagnetic Potts models  coupled ferromagnetically  We derive the Bethe Ansatz equations and study them numerically for two arbitrary twist angles  The continuum limit is shown to involve two compact bosons and one non compact boson  with discrete states emerging from the continuum at appropriate twists  The non compact boson entails strong logarithmic corrections to the finite size behaviour of the scaling levels  the understanding of which allows us to correct an earlier proposal for some of the critical exponents  In particular  we infer the full set of magnetic scaling dimensions  watermelon operators  of the Potts model  ,physics
Metric Dimension and Zero Forcing Number of Two Families of Line Graphs,  Zero forcing number has recently become an interesting graph parameter studied in its own right since its introduction by the  AIM Minimum Rank    Special Graphs Work Group   whereas metric dimension is a well known graph parameter  We investigate the metric dimension and the zero forcing number of some line graphs by first determining the metric dimension and the zero forcing number of the line graphs of wheel graphs and the bouquet of circles  We prove that  Z G   le  Z L G    for a simple and connected graph  G   Further  we show that  Z G   le Z L G    when  G  is a tree or when  G  contains a Hamiltonian path and has a certain number of edges  We compare the metric dimension with the zero forcing number of a line graph by demonstrating a couple of inequalities between the two parameters  We end by stating some open problems  ,maths
"The Glassey conjecture on asymptotically flat manifolds","We verify the   dimensional Glassey conjecture on asymptotically flat manifolds   R        g    where the metric  g  is certain small space time perturbation of the flat metric  as well as the nontrapping asymptotically Euclidean manifolds  Moreover  for radial asymptotically flat manifolds   R    n   g   with  n ge     we verify the Glassey conjecture in the radial case  High dimensional wave equations with higher regularity are also discussed  The main idea is to exploit local energy and KSS estimates with variable coefficients  together with the weighted Sobolev estimates including trace estimates",maths

"Faithful Variable Screening for High-Dimensional Convex Regression",  "We study the problem of variable selection in convex nonparametric regression  Under the assumption that the true regression function is convex and sparse  we develop a screening procedure to select a subset of variables that contains the relevant variables  Our approach is a two stage quadratic programming method that estimates a sum of one dimensional convex functions  followed by one dimensional concave regression fits on the residuals  In contrast to previous methods for sparse additive models  the optimization is finite dimensional and requires no tuning parameters for smoothness  Under appropriate assumptions  we prove that the procedure is faithful in the population setting  yielding no false negatives  We give a finite sample statistical analysis  and introduce algorithms for efficiently carrying out the required quadratic programs  The approach leads to computational and statistical advantages over fitting a full model  and provides an effective  practical approach to variable screening in convex regression",statistics 
"The Kernel Unipotent Conjecture and the vanishing of Massey products for odd rigid fields",  "A major difficult problem in Galois theory is the characterization of profinite groups which are realizable as absolute Galois groups of fields  Recently the Kernel  n  Unipotent Conjecture and the Vanishing  n  Massey Conjecture for  n geq    were formulated  These conjectures evolved in the last forty years as a byproduct of the application of topological methods to Galois cohomology  We show that both of these conjectures are true for odd rigid fields  This is the first case of a significant family of fields where both of the conjectures are verified besides fields whose Galois groups of  p  maximal extensions are free pro  p  groups  We also prove the Kernel Unipotent Conjecture for Demushkin groups of rank    and establish a number of further related results ",maths
"On the size of dissociated bases","We prove that the sizes of the maximal dissociated subsets of a given finite subset of an abelian group differ by a logarithmic factor at most  On the other hand  we show that the set          n seq Z n  possesses a dissociated subset of size   Ome n log n    since the standard basis of   Z n  is a maximal dissociated subset of          n  of size  n   the result just mentioned is essentially sharp" ,maths
"Bifurcation of critical points along gap-continuous families ofsubspaces",  "We consider the restriction of twice differentiable functionals on a Hilbert space to families of subspaces that vary continuously with respect to the gap metric  We study bifurcation of branches of critical points along these families  and apply our results to semilinear systems of ordinary differential equations" ,maths
"Combing Euclidean buildings", "For an arbitrary Euclidean building we define a certain combing  which satisfies the  fellow traveller property  and admits a recursive definition  Using this combing we prove that any group acting freely  cocompactly and by order preserving automorphisms on a Euclidean building of one of the types A n B n C n admits a biautomatic structure", maths
"Pointwise Characterizations of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces and Quasiconformal Mappings",  "In this paper  the authors characterize  in terms of pointwise inequalities  the classical Besov spaces   dot B s  p   q   and Triebel Lizorkin spaces   dot F s  p   q   for all  s in         and  p   q in n  n s     infty    both in    mathbb R  n  and in the metric measure spaces enjoying the doubling and reverse doubling properties  Applying this characterization  the authors prove that quasiconformal mappings preserve   dot F s  n s   q   on   rn  for all  s in         and  q in n  n s     infty    A metric measure space version of the above morphism property is also established", maths
