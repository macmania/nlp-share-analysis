Dynamic compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of the three sulfotransferases responsible for the bulk of sulfation in cartilage tissue. These results indicate a transient mechanotransduction reaction that differs based on the load regime. The effect of mechanical loading on the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate has been studied previously, however, this study seeks to examine more comprehensive loading regimes. Static compression and release resulted in an increase in 6-sulfation and a decrease in 4-sulfation that lasted to 48 hours after release of compression. Dynamic compression and release had the opposite effect on sulfation ratio, with an increase in 4-sulfation compared to 6-sulfation. The transcription changes seen in this study do not indicate the changes that occur in the end products of synthesis. Other factors may play a larger role, such as precursor availability or transport through the Golgi apparatus. Intracellular organelles react to static compression of the surrounding tissue in one of two manners. The majority of organelles deform much as the nucleus, proportionally in volume and shape to the cell. The Golgi apparatus appears to retain a significant portion of its volume relative to the cell and other organelles. In addition, it reforms structurally into a highly ordered stacked appearance.", "(cont.) Osmotic forces within the Golgi may allow it to balance the osmotic load in the cytoplasm and resist compression and altered trafficking of the Golgi may in turn produce the altered appearance. Recent microscopy experiments on the Golgi apparatus utilizing two-photon microscopy have allowed us to examine the reaction of live tissue to static compression. These results illustrate the significant, but differing, effects of static and dynamic compression on the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate. The effects of these compression types on the transcription of enzymes responsible for this biosynthesis cannot fully explain the changes seen in newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate. Organelle reorganization has been shown to occur in response to static load and it is possible that altered organelle trafficking plays a role in this altered biosynthesis. Further studies are necessary to determine the final effect of the altered transcription and organelle structure on the manufacture of this important cartilage molecule.", "by Jon D.

Microbial genomes, an increasingly accessible data source, provide an ideal entry point. The genome sequences of different microbes may be compared using the tools of population genetics to infer important genetic changes allowing them to diversify ecologically and adapt to distinct ecological niches. Yet the toolkit of population genetics was developed largely with sexual eukaryotes in mind. In this work, I assess and develop tools for inferring natural selection in microbial genomes. Many tools rely on population genetics theory, and thus require defining distinct populations, or species, of bacteria. Because sex (recombination) is not required for reproduction, some bacteria recombine only rarely, while others are extremely promiscuous, exchanging genes across great genetic distances. This behavior poses a challenge for defining microbial population boundaries. This thesis begins with a discussion of how recombination and positive selection interact to promote ecological adaptation. I then describe a general pipeline for quantifying the impacts of mutation, recombination and selection on microbial genomes, and apply it to two closely related, yet ecologically distinct populations of Vibrio splendidus, each with its own microhabitat preference. I introduce a new tool, STARRInIGHTS, for inferring homologous recombination events. By assessing rates of recombination within and between ecological populations, I conclude that ecological differentiation is driven by small number of habitat-specific alleles, while most loci are shared freely across habitats. The remainder of the thesis focuses on lineage-specific changes in natural selection among anciently diverged species of gamma proteobacteria. I develop two new metrics, selective signatures and slow:fast, for detecting deviations from the expected rate of evolution in 'core' proteins (present in single copy in most species). Because they rely on empirical distributions of evolutionary rates across species, these methods should become increasingly powerful as more and more microbial genomes are sampled.

Microbial genomes, an increasingly accessible data source, provide an ideal entry point. The genome sequences of different microbes may be compared using the tools of population genetics to infer important genetic changes allowing them to diversify ecologically and adapt to distinct ecological niches. Yet the toolkit of population genetics was developed largely with sexual eukaryotes in mind. In this work, I assess and develop tools for inferring natural selection in microbial genomes. Many tools rely on population genetics theory, and thus require defining distinct populations, or species, of bacteria. Because sex (recombination) is not required for reproduction, some bacteria recombine only rarely, while others are extremely promiscuous, exchanging genes across great genetic distances. This behavior poses a challenge for defining microbial population boundaries. This thesis begins with a discussion of how recombination and positive selection interact to promote ecological adaptation. I then describe a general pipeline for quantifying the impacts of mutation, recombination and selection on microbial genomes, and apply it to two closely related, yet ecologically distinct populations of Vibrio splendidus, each with its own microhabitat preference. I introduce a new tool, STARRInIGHTS, for inferring homologous recombination events. By assessing rates of recombination within and between ecological populations, I conclude that ecological differentiation is driven by small number of habitat-specific alleles, while most loci are shared freely across habitats. The remainder of the thesis focuses on lineage-specific changes in natural selection among anciently diverged species of gamma proteobacteria. I develop two new metrics, selective signatures and slow:fast, for detecting deviations from the expected rate of evolution in 'core' proteins (present in single copy in most species). Because they rely on empirical distributions of evolutionary rates across species, these methods should become increasingly powerful as more and more microbial genomes are sampled.

We previously reported that ALDH1-high cases of uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma showed poor prognosis, and that ALDH1 high population was more tumorigenic, invasive, and resistant to apoptosis than ALDH1 low population. Histamine plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Here, we examined the effect of histamine on ALDH1 expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line. The addition of histamine increased ALDH1 high population, which was consistent with the result that histamine enhanced the invasive ability and the resistance to anticancer drug. Among 4 types of histamine receptors, histamine H1 and H2 receptor (H1R and H2R) were expressed in endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line. The addition of H1R agonist but not H2R agonist increased ALDH1. The antagonist H1R but not H2R inhibited the effect of histamine on ALDH1 expression. These results indicated that histamine increased the expression of ALDH1 via H1R but not H2R.

Nuclear eccentricity was also increased for the anisotropic tissues, suggesting that intracellular forces deform the nucleus as the cell is spatially confined. During systole, nuclei experienced increasing spatial confinement in magnitude and direction of displacement as tissue anisotropy increased, yielding anisotropic deformation. Thus, the nature of nuclear displacement and deformation during systole appears to rely on a combination of the passive myofibril spatial organization and the active stress fields induced by contraction. Such findings have implications in understanding the genomic consequences and functional response of cardiac myocytes to their ECM surroundings under conditions of disease."}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["sprague-dawley", "cell nucleus", "animals", "cell size", "biomedical engineering and bioengineering", "cells", "elastic modulus", "cultured", "myocytes", "newborn", "cellular", "cardiac", "rats", "tissue engineering", "mechanotransduction"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2014-11-19T21:50:19", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.cmu.edu/bme/103"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "The activated B-cell\u2013like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer that can only be cured in roughly 40% of cases.

For both research and clinical applications concurrent multimodality data collection plays an important role in understanding the signal sources. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are particularly interesting examples, in that each offers largely independent yet complementary information on neuronal activity. While we and others have made great strides in making concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings possible, the EEG data, in particular, still contain signal artifacts of cardiac origin (ballistocardiogram) that make EEG analysis difficult, or even impossible. To date, no satisfying means to separate brain EEG signal and ballistocardiogram (BCG) exist especially for non-event-related-potential experiments and under 3-T MR scanner. The BCG presents high temporal non-stationarity due to variation in cardiac cycles, and its amplitude scales with magnetic field strength. This explains the considerable variation of success levels among studies, with more successful applications achieved at lower field strength. Previously published methods used one of blind source separation methods to remove the BCG. All such blind source separation approaches are limited to performing component extraction based on the contaminated data alone, agnostic of the structural difference between BCG and EEG. Another kind of approach is to utilize reference signals for the artifact itself. However, this requires purpose-built hardware and exploits no further denoising step besides a simple subtraction.We have developed three algorithms to separate EEG signal and BCG artifacts. Firstly, we have designed a Direct Recording - Prior Encoding (DRPE) method to maximally incorporate prior knowledge of BCG/EEG subspaces described by bases learned from a modified recording configuration, and of the group sparsity characteristics in the signal. To further promote subspace separability, a Direct Recording Joint Incoherent Basis (DRJIB) method is proposed to learn a representative and sparse set of BCG and EEG bases by minimizing a cost function consisting of group sparsity penalties for automatic dimension selection and an energy term for encouraging incoherence. Reconstruction is subsequently obtained by fitting the contaminated data to a generative model using the learned bases subject to regularization. The third algorithm takes advantage of currently available high-density EEG cap, to reliably estimate the full-scalp BCG contribution from a near-optimal small subset (20 out of 256) of channels and a corresponding weight through our modified experimental setup using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). We show in carefully constructed simulations that the residual artifacts are reduced by several orders of magnitude to a tiny fraction of the true signal. In human studies we show that the methods work effectively, and validate our quantitative results. Beyond the application to the EEG-fMRI challenge, we expect that our algorithmic methods will have impact in many other domains where signal and contaminant have distinct information structures. Digital signal, imaging, or even financial data are also contaminated with noises so that studying and characterizing the information structures of desired and undesired signals would greatly improve the modeling power.", "contributors": [{"name": "XIA, HONGJING", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "XIA", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "HONGJING", "email": ""}], "title": "Ballistocardiogram (BCG) Removal for Continuous EEG Recordings inside a 3-T MR scanner", "shareProperties": {"source": "ucescholarship"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "dissertation"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["qt20z7n39x", "http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/20z7n39x", "http://n2t.net/ark:/13030/m5qr70ws", "qt20z7n39x"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": []}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "XIA, HONGJING.

A common feature of neurodegenerative diseases is progressive dysfunction and death of neurons in key regions of the brain. Observations of dysregulated cell cycle proteins in the brains of patients, along with research in animal models and cultured cells, suggest that aberrant functions of cell cycle proteins contribute to neuronal death and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.\nThe p53 tumor suppressor is a key component in cell cycle signaling and cell death. p53 maintains multiple functions related to cellular homeostasis and cell fate determination, and is negatively regulated by two E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and MDMX (murine double minute X). MDM2 and MDMX promote cell survival and are implicated in several types of cancer, but the functions of MDMX in neurons are largely unknown. MDMX promotes survival in cultured neurons, but becomes degraded in response to neurotoxic stress, leading to a conclusion that MDMX acts as a \u201cnode\u201d for stress factors in neuronal death.\nThis thesis examines mechanisms by which MDMX promotes neuronal survival, and how MDMX functions become disrupted during neurodegenerative disease. Utilizing human tissue samples, rodent models, and pharmacological experiments in cultured neurons, we determined how MDMX is affected in AD and HAND, and how these changes relate to neuronal damage. First, we demonstrate that calpain\u2013mediated loss of MDMX contributes to neuronal damage in a model of HAND, and that MDMX overexpression protects neurons in this model. In our second body of work, we demonstrate that neuronal MDMX is reduced in AD and in AD models due to amyloid\u2013induced caspase activation, and that loss of MDMX function contributes to pathological processes observed in AD, including mitochondrial damage, calpain activation, and Cdk5 hyperactivity. Finally, we examine p53 as a downstream effector of MDMX in neurons.\nWe conclude that the oncoprotein MDMX promotes neuronal survival through regulation of mitochondria, calpains, and Cdk5.

Several challenges such as the dynamic nature of cellular systems, uncertainty due to environmental influences, and the heterogeneity between individual patients render this a difficult task. In the last decade, several algorithms have been proposed to elucidate cellular systems from data, resulting in numerous data-driven hypotheses. However, due to the large number of variables involved in the process, many of which are unknown or not measurable, such computational approaches often lead to a high proportion of false positives. This renders interpretation of the data-driven hypotheses extremely difficult. Consequently, a dismal proportion of these hypotheses are subject to further experimental validation, eventually limiting their potential to augment existing biological knowledge. This dissertation develops a framework of computational methods for the analysis of such data-driven hypotheses leveraging existing biological knowledge.

Several challenges such as the dynamic nature of cellular systems, uncertainty due to environmental influences, and the heterogeneity between individual patients render this a difficult task. In the last decade, several algorithms have been proposed to elucidate cellular systems from data, resulting in numerous data-driven hypotheses. However, due to the large number of variables involved in the process, many of which are unknown or not measurable, such computational approaches often lead to a high proportion of false positives. This renders interpretation of the data-driven hypotheses extremely difficult. Consequently, a dismal proportion of these hypotheses are subject to further experimental validation, eventually limiting their potential to augment existing biological knowledge. This dissertation develops a framework of computational methods for the analysis of such data-driven hypotheses leveraging existing biological knowledge. Specifically, I show how biological knowledge can be mapped onto these hypotheses and subsequently augmented through novel hypotheses.

This study explores the structural features that enable Cas9 to bind and cleave target DNAs, and the results suggest a way of regulating Cas9 by physical separation of the catalytic domains from the rest of the protein scaffold.", "contributors": [{"name": "Wright, Addison V.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wright", "additionalName": "V.", "givenName": "Addison", "email": ""}, {"name": "Sternberg, Samuel H.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Sternberg", "additionalName": "H.", "givenName": "Samuel", "email": ""}, {"name": "Taylor, David W.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Taylor", "additionalName": "W.", "givenName": "David", "email": ""}, {"name": "Staahl, Brett T.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Staahl", "additionalName": "T.", "givenName": "Brett", "email": ""}, {"name": "Bardales, Jorge A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Bardales", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Jorge", "email": ""}, {"name": "Kornfeld, Jack E.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Kornfeld", "additionalName": "E.", "givenName": "Jack", "email": ""}, {"name": "Doudna, Jennifer A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Doudna", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Jennifer", "email": ""}], "title": "Rational design of a split-Cas9 enzyme complex", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biological sciences"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-19T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364227"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "MyJove Corporation"}, "description": "Spermatogonial stem and progenitor cells (SSCs) of the testis represent a classic example of adult mammalian stem cells and preserve fertility for nearly the lifetime of the animal.

In comparison to these time-consuming approaches, we have recently found that combined inhibition of three signaling pathways, TGF\u03b2/SMAD2, BMP/SMAD1, and FGF/ERK, promotes rapid induction of neuroectoderm from hPSCs, followed by immediate differentiation into functional neurons. Here, we have adapted our procedure to a novel multititre plate format, to further enhance its reproducibility and to make it compatible with mid-throughput applications. It comprises four days of neuroectoderm formation in floating spheres (embryoid bodies), followed by a further four days of differentiation into neurons under adherent conditions. Most cells obtained with this protocol appear to be bipolar sensory neurons. Moreover, the procedure is highly efficient, does not require particular expert skills, and is based on a simple chemically defined medium with cost-efficient small molecules. Due to these features, the procedure may serve as a useful platform for further functional investigation as well as for cell-based screening approaches requiring human sensory neurons or neurons of any type.", "contributors": [{"name": "Zhang, Miao", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zhang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Miao", "email": ""}, {"name": "Sch\u00f6ler, Hans R.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Sch\u00f6ler", "additionalName": "R.", "givenName": "Hans", "email": ""}, {"name": "Greber, Boris", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Greber", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Boris", "email": ""}], "title": "Rapid and Efficient Generation of Neurons from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in a Multititre Plate Format", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["stem cell biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-05T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3622096"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Error backpropagation is an extremely effective algorithm for assigning\ncredit in artificial neural networks.

Researchers have long postulated that living organisms utilize the macromolecules of organic matrices to actively guide the formation of crystal structures. The timing and placement of the subsequent minerals that form are most easily controlled during nucleation; however, a physical and chemical picture of how organic functional group chemistry influences the initial stages of nucleation is not yet established. These processes are further complicated by the realization that carbonate biominerals can form by an amorphous to crystalline transformation process, which has prompted the question of how chemical signatures are recorded during mineralization.  Investigations of mineralization processes such as the kinetics of nucleation and the transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to crystalline products are critical to building a better understanding of biomineral formation.  Only from that fundamental basis can one begin to decipher changes in climate and seawater chemistry over geologic time and by recent anthropogenic effects.\n\nThis dissertation presents the findings from experimental studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of multiple mineral formation processes, including nucleation and transformation from an amorphous phase. The kinetics of calcite nucleation onto a suite of high-purity polysaccharide (PS) substrates were quantified under controlled conditions. Nucleation rates were measured as a function of 1) supersaturation extending above and below ACC solubility and 2) ionic strength extending to seawater salinity.  These conditions decipher the chemical interactions between the PS substrate, calcite crystal, and solution. These investigations show the energy barrier to calcite formation is regulated by competing interfacial energies between the substrate, crystal, and liquid.  The energy barriers to nucleation are PS-specific by a systematic relationship to PS charge density and substrate structure that is rooted in minimization of the competing substrate-crystal and substrate-liquid interfacial energies.  The data also suggest ionic strength regulates nucleation barriers through substrate-liquid and crystal-liquid interfacial energetics.\n\nIn a second experimental study, stable isotope labeling was used to directly probe the transformation pathway.  Four processes were considered: dissolution-reprecipitation, solid-state, or combinations of these end member processes. Isotope measurements of calcite crystals that transform from ACC have signatures that are best explained by dissolution-reprecipitation. The extent of isotopic mixing correlates with the amount of ACC transferred and the time to transformation, suggesting the calcite crystals are recording the changing local solution environment during the transformation.  These investigations into different mineralization mechanisms build a framework for how functional group chemistries of organic molecules regulate mineralization and the resulting isotopic and elemental signatures in the calcite.  This may provide useful insights to interpreting chemical signatures of carbonate biominerals in fossil record and understanding ocean chemistry changes throughout geologic time.", "contributors": [{"name": "Giuffre, Anthony J", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Giuffre", "additionalName": "J", "givenName": "Anthony", "email": ""}, {"name": "Geosciences", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Geosciences", "email": ""}, {"name": "Dove, Patricia M.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Dove", "additionalName": "M.", "givenName": "Patricia", "email": ""}, {"name": "Rimstidt, James D", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Rimstidt", "additionalName": "D", "givenName": "James", "email": ""}, {"name": "Hochella, Michael F", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hochella", "additionalName": "F", "givenName": "Michael", "email": ""}, {"name": "De Yoreo, James J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "De Yoreo", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "James", "email": ""}, {"name": "Roman, Maren", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Roman", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Maren", "email": ""}], "title": "Biomolecular Controls on Calcium Carbonate Formation by Amorphous and Classical Pathways: Insights from Measurements of Nucleation Rates and Isotope Tracers", "shareProperties": {"source": "vtech"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "Other - Dissertation"}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": []}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "ETD"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": ["2015-04-27T08:00:11Z", "2015-04-27T08:00:11Z", "2015-04-26"]}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["vt_gsexam:4803", "http://hdl.handle.net/10919/51821", "oai:vtechworks.lib.vt.edu:10919/51821"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["com_10919_5534", "col_10919_11041"]}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": "The authors of the theses and dissertations are the copyright owners.

The combined treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor and conventional photon radiation also showed more effective tumor growth delay than radiation alone. However, little is known regarding the combined treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor and heavy-ion irradiation. In this study, SQ5 human lung tumor cells were used in vitro for clonogenic cell survival and in vivo for tumor growth delay measurement using a mouse xenograft model after 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) pretreatment and carbon ion irradiation. Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was also assessed along with expressions of DSB repair-related proteins. Cell cycle analysis after the combined treatment was also performed. The combined treatment of 17AAG and carbon ions revealed a promising treatment option in both in vitro and in vivo studies. One likely cause of this effectiveness was shown to be the inhibition of homologous recombination repair by 17AAG. The more intensified G2 cell cycle delay was also associated with the combined treatment when compared with carbon ion treatment alone.

It is likely that global\nclimatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant\nimpact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these\npatterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is\nparticularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we\nintegrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of\ntrophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited\nmammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during\nthe Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional\ncontribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the\nstructure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial\nMaximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe\ncommunities.

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) regulates thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis and uracil accumulation in DNA, and as such affects genome stability. Previously, we showed that decreased SHMT1 expression in Shmt1 knockout mice (Shmt1\u2212/+) or its impaired nuclear localization, as occurs in mice over-expressing an Shmt1 transgene (Shmt1tg+), results in elevated uracil incorporation into DNA, which could affect colon cancer risk. We used these 2 models to determine the effect of altered SHMT1 expression and localization, and its interaction with folate insufficiency, on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer in mice. Shmt1\u2212/+ and Shmt1tg+ mice were weaned to a control or folate-and-choline-deficient (FCD) diet and fed the diet for 28 or 32 wk, respectively. At 6 wk of age, mice were injected weekly for 6 wk with 10 mg/kg AOM (w/v in saline). Colon uracil concentrations in nuclear DNA were elevated 2\u20137 fold in Shmt1\u2212/+ and Shmt1tg+ mice. However, colon tumor incidence and numbers were not dependent on SHMT1 expression in Shmt1\u2212/+ or Shmt1\u2212/\u2212 mice. The FCD diet reduced tumor load independent of Shmt1 genotype. In contrast, Shmt1tg+ mice exhibited a 30% reduction in tumor incidence, a 50% reduction in tumor number, and a 60% reduction in tumor load compared with wild-type mice independent of dietary folate intake. Our data indicate that uracil accumulation in DNA does not predict tumor number in AOM-mediated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, enrichment of SHMT1 in the cytoplasm, as observed in Shmt1tg+ mice, protects against AOM-mediated carcinogenesis independent of its role in nuclear de novo dTMP biosynthesis.", "contributors": [{"name": "MacFarlane, Amanda J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "MacFarlane", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "Amanda", "email": ""}, {"name": "McEntee, Michael F.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "McEntee", "additionalName": "F.", "givenName": "Michael", "email": ""}, {"name": "Stover, Patrick J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Stover", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "Patrick", "email": ""}], "title": "Azoxymethane-Induced Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice Occurs Independently of De Novo Thymidylate Synthesis Capacity123", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biochemical", "molecular", "and genetic mechanisms"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083238"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Deep graph-theoretic ideas in the context with the graph of the World Wide\nWeb led to the definition of Google's PageRank and the subsequent rise of the\nmost-popular search engine to date.

Structural and diversity parameters (species richness, Shannon index, evenness) were measured for both insect orders and trophic guilds. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied to determine how vegetation parameters (species richness and cover) influence spatial and seasonal fluctuations of insect assemblages. The catches totalled 434 insect individuals classified into 75 species, 62 genera, 31 families and 7 orders, of which Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were the most abundant and constant over seasons and study stations. Spring and autumn presented the highest values of diversity parameters. Individual-based Chao-1 species richness estimator indicated 126 species for the total individuals captured in the Sabkha. Based on catch abundances, the structure of functional trophic groups was predators (37.3%), saprophages (26.7%), phytophages (20.5%), polyphages (10.8%), coprophages (4.6%); whereas in terms of numbers of species, they can be classified as phytophages (40%), predators (25.3%), polyphages (13.3%), saprophages (12%), coprophages (9.3%). The CCA demonstrated that phytophages and saprophages as well as Coleoptera and Orthoptera were positively correlated with the two parameters of vegetation, especially in spring and summer. While the abundance of coprophages was positively correlated with species richness of plants, polyphage density was positively associated with vegetation cover.

Though there exist several\ntools addressing these problems individually, the scientific community still\nlacks an environment that combines these three capabilities together. NaviCell\nis a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions,\ncreated in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and\nmaintenance. NaviCell combines three features: (1) efficient map browsing based\non Google Maps engine; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of\ndetails or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for\ncollecting the community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in\nthe field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of their\ninterest in the context of signaling pathways and cross-talks between pathways\nwithin a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed\nmolecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map\nup to a top-level modular representation.

Numerous transgenic strains expressing these fluorophores in specific neurons are readily available or can be constructed using well-established techniques.

We discuss advantages and disadvantages of both as well as various methods of sample preparation (animal immobilization) and image analysis. Finally, we present results from two experiments: 1) Using GCaMP to measure the sensory response of a specific neuron to an external electrical field and 2) Using cameleon to measure the physiological calcium response of a neuron to traumatic laser damage.

Understanding the complex EGFR regulatory network is critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. To this end, this work investigated the functions of two incompletely characterized regulators of EGFR trafficking and signaling, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) and Sprouty2 (SPRY2), in two cancer settings where EGFR mutation is common, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In NSCLC cells, results indicate that MIG6, an endogenous inhibitor of EGFR activity and endocytic adaptor, is surprisingly responsible for at least half of EGFR endocytosis, suggesting that a substantial fraction of internalized EGFR may not be competent to drive signaling. Computational modeling further suggested that in cells expressing kinase-activated, endocytosis-impaired EGFR mutants, the importance of MIG6 relative to other endocytic pathways is increased, but that MIG6 internalization capacity is reduced compared to cells expressing wild-type EGFR. Additional data indicate that SPRY2 expression reduces EGFR endocytosis rate primarily by promoting EGFR expression, which overwhelms the saturable EGFR endocytic pathway, but that SPRY2 also promotes ERK phosphorylation and resistance to EGFR inhibition independent of EGFR expression level. In GBM cell lines, our data demonstrate that SPRY2 expression promotes proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, resistance to EGFR and c-MET co-inhibition, and growth as mouse tumor xenografts. Additional studies identified SPRY2-mediated regulation of the strength and effects of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways as important for controlling GBM cell behaviors. Through analysis of public datasets and a collaborative analysis of human and rat tumors, we further found that elevated SPRY2 expression is associated with reduced patient survival and expression of EGFR variant III, an EGFR mutant linked to aggressive GBM. Thus, while SPRY2 is a candidate tumor suppressor in other contexts, our results support a tumor promoter role for SPRY2 in GBM and identify SPRY2 and the pathways it regulates as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for therapeutic response. Overall, these findings add new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the complexities of EGFR trafficking and signaling regulation and the functions of SPRY2 and MIG6 that may be leveraged to develop improved cancer therapies.", "contributors": [{"name": "Walsh, Alice Macdonald", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Walsh", "additionalName": "Macdonald", "givenName": "Alice", "email": ""}], "title": "Regulation of cell signaling by MIG6 and Sprouty2 in cancers with EGFR mutations", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1302", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2426&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2426"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["publication:be", "publication:edissertations", "publication:seas"]}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer", "drug resistance", "feedback", "cell biology", "biomedical", "computational modeling", "signaling"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T19:01:32", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1302"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Lifetime distributions of social entities, such as enterprises, products, and\nmedia contents, are one of the fundamental statistics characterizing the social\ndynamics.

The soil-dwelling [alpha]-proteobacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, not only has to accurately coordinate the replication of its tripartite genome, but also must undergo a dramatic cellular differentiation in order to form an effective symbiosis with the legume Medicago sativa. Preliminary analyses have indicated that plasticity in the S. meliloti cell cycle regulatory network may be essential to symbiosis, but cell cycle research in S. meliloti has been hindered largely by lack of a method to obtain synchronous populations of S. meliloti. In this thesis, I present the first method to generate synchronous cultures of S. meliloti. I performed microarray gene expression analysis on synchronous populations of S. meliloti to gain a global view of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle events. This represents the first work of this kind done in an [alpha]-proteobacterium besides Caulobacter crescentus, which is the current model for [alpha]-proteobacterial cell cycle studies. The importance of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle progression was first discovered in C. crescentus and the work presented in this thesis highlights the conservation of cell cycle regulated gene expression in S. meliloti. I identified 462 cell cycle regulated transcripts in S. meliloti, which included genes involved in vital cell processes such as cell division, flagella biogenesis, replication and segregation of its tripartite genome as well as several putative cell cycle regulators. I compared the set of genes with cell cycle regulated transcripts identified in my analysis with the set identified in C. crescentus to generate a core set of 128 conserved genes demonstrating cell cycle regulated gene expression in both species. To determine which of the S. meliloti genes with cell cycle regulated transcripts might be part of the CtrA and DnaA regulons in S. meiloti, I performed CtrA and DnaA binding motif analysis. To understand the evolutionary significance of these CtrA and DnaA binding motifs, I looked at conservation of these motifs in homologous genes from several related [alpha]-proteobacteria. The results indicated that the putative CtrA regulon might be more evolutionarily constrained than the putative DnaA regulon. Organisms more closely related to S. meliloti or with more similar lifestyles demonstrated a much greater conservation of the CtrA binding motifs identified in S. meliloti. The CtrA binding motifs in S. meliloti identified by my analysis were not at all well conserved in C. crescentus, which was the most distantly related [alpha]-proteobacteria surveyed. These differences in cell cycle regulated transcription and the putative CtrA regulon between S. meliloti and C. crescentus thus appear to represent specific adaptations to the distinctive genome and unique intracellular symbiotic lifestyle of S. meliloti and illustrate the importance of S. meliloti as a model for cell cycle regulation in [alpha]-proteobacteria with similar intracellular lifestyles. The work presented in this thesis also describes the importance of CtrA regulation in S. meliloti during symbiosis with M. sativa. A crucial part of this symbiosis is a striking cellular differentiation (termed bacteroid differentiation), which includes changes in membrane permeability, cell elongation and branching, endoreduplication of the genome and loss of reproductive capacity and therefore a significant deviation from the free-living cell cycle program. Endoreduplication of the genome requires a decoupling of DNA replication and cell division, which could be achieved by down-regulation of the essential master cell cycle regulator CtrA. I tested the effects of CtrA depletion in S. meliloti and found that CtrA depletion induces a bacteroid-like state characterized by elongated and branched cells and highly elevated DNA content. I also show that S. meliloti CtrA has a comparable half-life to C. crescentus CtrA, but regulated proteolysis of CtrA may be different in the two species since we found CtrA proteolysis to be essential in S. meliloti. In addition, I demonstrate that the promoter and coding regions of C. crescentus ctrA cannot complement an S. meliloti ctrA chromosomal deletion during symbiosis even though they can do so in the free-living state. My attempts to identify the defects in the function C. cresentus ctrA promoter or coding region within M. sativa gave surprising results since S. melioti strains expressing C. crescentus CtrA from the S. meliloti ctrA promoter region and vice versa were able to establish an effective symbiosis with M. sativa. I discuss several possibilities to explain this apparent paradox, but further study is required to fully clarify this observation. Taken as a whole, my thesis work represents a significant advancement to the field of cell cycle research in S. meliloti and [alpha]-proteobacteria as a whole. The cell synchronization method I developed will greatly facilitate more comprehensive analysis of cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti. My microarray gene expression analysis provides a global view of cell cycle regulated transcription in S. meliloti, which can be used in more in-depth explorations of specific mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle events in S. meliloti.

The soil-dwelling [alpha]-proteobacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti, not only has to accurately coordinate the replication of its tripartite genome, but also must undergo a dramatic cellular differentiation in order to form an effective symbiosis with the legume Medicago sativa. Preliminary analyses have indicated that plasticity in the S. meliloti cell cycle regulatory network may be essential to symbiosis, but cell cycle research in S. meliloti has been hindered largely by lack of a method to obtain synchronous populations of S. meliloti. In this thesis, I present the first method to generate synchronous cultures of S. meliloti. I performed microarray gene expression analysis on synchronous populations of S. meliloti to gain a global view of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle events. This represents the first work of this kind done in an [alpha]-proteobacterium besides Caulobacter crescentus, which is the current model for [alpha]-proteobacterial cell cycle studies. The importance of transcriptional regulation of cell cycle progression was first discovered in C. crescentus and the work presented in this thesis highlights the conservation of cell cycle regulated gene expression in S. meliloti.

It has been recognized as a plausible method to address issues related to atmospheric carbon increase and global change, in addition to food insecurity. This research explores the effectiveness of biochar as a soil amendment. This knowledge is necessary because the effects of drought have strengthened, flagging the necessity to develop sustainable methods that will address (1) water shortage and (2) the increasing use of groundwater, which has generated poorly infiltrating, saline-sodic soils. Previous biochar studies have emphasized its increased cation exchange capacity, surface area, and porosity, qualities of which can improve the soil water retention and infiltration rate of soils experiencing drought. Here we investigate the hydraulic and physical impacts of amending an arable loamy sand soil with almond residue biochar of different temperatures, size, and rates. Our biochar was observed to increase in carbon (C) content and stability with temperature of pyrolysis; size was inversely related to C concentration. Additionally, biochar cation exchange capacity and surface area increased with increasing temperature and decreasing size. While these attributes may suggest enhanced aggregate stability and water retention, our findings showed that aggregate stability decreased with biochar addition alone, but increased with wetting/drying cycles; water retention was reduced with increased rates of biochar application, regardless of temperature. Infiltration was observed to increase upon initial application, but reduced with time, regardless of biochar size, temperature, or rate. These findings suggest that almond residue biochar may only be beneficial for retention purposes at low temperature and low application rates, while infiltration increases will likely only be observed for the first few days of application. The results of this study contribute to the growing body of biochar literature, and will be useful in tailoring management practices in improving the infiltration of arable sandy soils if using biochar is of interest.", "contributors": [{"name": "Lopez, Vivian Dominique", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lopez", "additionalName": "Dominique", "givenName": "Vivian", "email": ""}], "title": "Biochar as a soil amendment: Impact on hydraulic and physical properties of an arable loamy sand soil", "shareProperties": {"source": "ucescholarship"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "dissertation"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["qt3223673m", "http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/3223673m", "http://n2t.net/ark:/13030/m5g74v3b", "qt3223673m"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": []}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Lopez, Vivian Dominique.

Our previous structure/activity analysis of the small-molecule inhibitor, BLT-1, established that the sulfur in the thiosemicarbazone moiety of BLT-1 was essential for its inhibitory activity in lipid transport. This thesis demonstrates that BLT-1 is an irreversible inhibitor of SR-BI, raising the possibility that cysteine(s) in SR-BI interact with BLT-1. Mass spectrometric analysis of purified SR-BI showed two of its six exoplasmic cysteines have free thiol groups (Cys251 and Cys384), and the other four are connected by two disulfide bonds within the conserved Cys321-Pro322-Cys323 (CPC) motif and between Cys280 and Cys334. Converting Cys384 (but not Cys251) to serine resulted in a complete loss of BLT-1 sensitivity.

As an example, we consider a lattice of nuclei responding to a\nconcentration field of a transcriptional regulator (the \"input\") by expressing\na single diffusible target gene. When input concentrations are low, diffusive\ncoupling markedly improves information transmission; optimal gene activation\nfunctions also systematically change. A qualitatively new regulatory strategy\nemerges where individual cells respond to the input in a nearly step-like\nfashion that is subsequently averaged out by strong diffusion. While motivated\nby early patterning events in the Drosophila embryo, our framework is\ngenerically applicable to spatially coupled stochastic gene expression models.\n", "Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures (incl. 3 supporting figures)"]}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["quantitative biology - molecular networks"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-19T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04015"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Experimental fMRI studies have shown that spontaneous brain activity i.e. in\nthe absence of any external input, exhibit complex spatial and temporal\npatterns of co-activity between segregated brain regions.

The prevalence of piggyBac(PB)-like terminal repeat (TR) elements in the human genome raises concerns. We evaluated if there were undesired genomic effects of the PB transposon system to modify human cells. Expression of the transposase alone revealed no mobilization of endogenous PB-like sequences in the human genome and no increase in DNA double-strand breaks. The use of PB in a plasmid containing both transposase and transposon greatly increased the probability of transposase integration; however, using transposon and transposase from separate vectors circumvented this. Placing a eGFP transgene within transposon vector backbone allowed isolation of cells free from vector backbone DNA. We confirmed observable directional promoter activity within the 5\u2032TR element of PB but found no significant enhancer effects from the transposon DNA sequence. Long-term culture of primary human cells modified with eGFP-transposons revealed no selective growth advantage of transposon-harboring cells.

Could those difference in behaviors explain why the AHB are\nless susceptible to Colony Collapse Disorder?\n  In order to answer this question, we propose a mathematical model of the\ncoexistence dynamics of these two species, the bee and the mite, to analyze the\nrole of resistance behaviors in the overall health of the colony, and, as a\nconsequence, its ability to face epidemiological challenges.\n"}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["quantitative biology - quantitative methods"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-26T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07077"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}, "description": "Background: The alternative NF-\u03baB pathway plays important roles in osteoclastogenesis through an unknown mechanism.", "contributors": [{"name": "Taniguchi, Rei", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Taniguchi", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Rei", "email": ""}, {"name": "Fukushima, Hidefumi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Fukushima", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Hidefumi", "email": ""}, {"name": "Osawa, Kenji", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Osawa", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Kenji", "email": ""}, {"name": "Maruyama, Toshimasa", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Maruyama", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Toshimasa", "email": ""}, {"name": "Yasuda, Hisataka", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Yasuda", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Hisataka", "email": ""}, {"name": "Weih, Falk", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Weih", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Falk", "email": ""}, {"name": "Doi, Takahiro", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Doi", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Takahiro", "email": ""}, {"name": "Maki, Kenshi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Maki", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Kenshi", "email": ""}, {"name": "Jimi, Eijiro", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Jimi", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Eijiro", "email": ""}], "title": "RelB-induced Expression of Cot, an MAP3K Family Member, Rescues RANKL-induced Osteoclastogenesis in Alymphoplasia Mice by Promoting NF-\u03baB2 Processing by IKK\u03b1*", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cell biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-14T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3953251"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Subdiffusion has been proposed as an explanation of various kinetic phenomena\ninside living cells.

It is mediated by the type IV pilus (T4P) and requires the exopolysaccharide (EPS) to function. It is clear that T4P retraction powers S motility. EPS on a neighboring cell or deposited on a gliding surface is proposed to anchor the distal end of a pilus and trigger T4P retraction at its proximal end. Inversely, T4P has been shown to regulate EPS production upstream of the Dif signaling pathway. Here we describe the isolation of two Tn insertions at the stk locus which had been known to play roles in cellular cohesion and formation of cell groups. An insertion in stkA (MXAN_3474) was identified based on its ability to restore EPS to a pilA deletion mutant. The stkA encodes a DnaK or Hsp70 homolog and it is upstream of stkB (MXAN_3475) and stkC (MXAN_3476). A stkB insertion was identified in a separate genetic screen because it eliminated EPS production of an EPS+ parental strain. Our results with in-frame deletions of these three stk genes indicated that the stkA mutant produced increased level of EPS while stkB and stkC mutants produced less EPS relative to the wild type. S motility and developmental aggregation were affected by deletions of stkA and stkB but only minimally by the deletion of stkC. Genetic epistasis indicated that StkA functions downstream of T4P but upstream of the Dif proteins as a negative regulator of EPS production in M. xanthus.", "contributors": [{"name": "Moak, Pamela L.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Moak", "additionalName": "L.", "givenName": "Pamela", "email": ""}, {"name": "Black, Wesley P.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Black", "additionalName": "P.", "givenName": "Wesley", "email": ""}, {"name": "Wallace, Regina A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wallace", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Regina", "email": ""}, {"name": "Li, Zhuo", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Li", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Zhuo", "email": ""}, {"name": "Yang, Zhaomin", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Yang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Zhaomin", "email": ""}], "title": "The Hsp70-like StkA functions between T4P and Dif signaling proteins as a negative regulator of exopolysaccharide in Myxococcus xanthus", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["developmental biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-11T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4319316"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  This chapter reviews the differential geometry-based solvation and\nelectrolyte transport for biomolecular solvation that have been developed over\nthe past decade.

Optimal shapes for the speed and the power efficiency are reported. Effects of Brownian motion and electrostatic interactions are excluded to emphasize the role of hydrodynamic forces on lateral velocities and rotations on the trajectory of swimmers. For thin flagella, as the channel radius decreases, forward velocity and the power efficiency of the swimmer decreases as well; however, for thick flagella, there is an optimal radius of the channel that maximizes the velocity and the efficiency depending on other geometric parameters.

To elucidate this regulatory mechanism, the three-dimensional organization of troponin and tropomyosin on the thin filament must be determined. Although tropomyosin is well defined in electron microscopy helical reconstructions of thin filaments, troponin density is mostly lost. Here, we determined troponin organization on native relaxed cardiac muscle thin filaments by applying single particle reconstruction procedures to negatively stained specimens. Multiple reference models led to the same final structure, indicating absence of model bias in the procedure. The new reconstructions clearly showed F-actin, tropomyosin, and troponin densities. At the 25\u00a0\u00c5 resolution achieved, troponin was considerably better defined than in previous reconstructions. The troponin density closely resembled the shape of troponin crystallographic structures, facilitating detailed interpretation of the electron microscopy density map. The orientation of troponin-T and the troponin core domain established troponin polarity. Density attributable to the troponin-I mobile regulatory domain was positioned where it could hold tropomyosin in its blocking position on actin, thus suggesting the underlying structural basis of thin filament regulation. Our previous understanding of thin filament regulation had been limited to known movements of tropomyosin that sterically block and unblock myosin binding sites on actin.

Its structure can be changed by applying forces and torques in single molecule experiments. In these experiments DNA has been seen to form super-helical structures (supercoils), collapse into tightly condensed states (toroids) and undergo structural changes (phase transitions). Our work focuses on studying all these phenomena by accounting for DNA elasticity, entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations and electrostatics.\nFirst, we study the DNA compaction problem in super-helices and toroidal structures. To do so we combine a fluctuating elastic rod model of DNA with electrostatic models for DNA-DNA interactions. Our models are able to predict the onset of the transition to supercoils and toroids under a wide range of experimental conditions. Next, we address DNA phase changes in the presence of mechanical loads.A phenomenon well known from experiments is the overstretching transition associated with the sudden change of DNA extension at high tensions. Depending on the ionic concentration, temperature and pulling rate, DNA can either transform into a melted state (inner strand separation) or S-DNA.\nMotivated by this, we study the equilibrium and kinetics of the DNA overstretching transitions making use of a quartic potential and non-gaussian integrals to evaluate the free energy of the system. We find that the cooperativity of the transition is a key variable that characterizes the overstretched state.\nIn a separate study we make use of a heterogeneous fluctuating rod model to examine the hypothesis that a newly discovered left-handed form called L-DNA is a mixture of two relatively well-characterized DNA phases - S-DNA and Z-DNA. L-DNA is stable at high tensions and negative twist. We show that if the idea of a mixed state is correct, then the content of S-DNA and Z-DNA varies as a function of the ionic concentration. Finally, we also use our fluctuating rod model to study the mechanical properties of drug-DNA complexes. We show that our methods can predict the results of experiments from various labs if we use only one set of experiments to fit the data to our model.", "contributors": [{"name": "Argudo, David E", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Argudo", "additionalName": "E", "givenName": "David", "email": ""}], "title": "Dna Conformational Changes And Phase Transitions Induced By Tension And Twist", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1004", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2128&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2128"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": "publication:edissertations"}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["dna phase transitions", "mechanical engineering", "statistical mechanics", "dna mechanics", "biophysics", "dna kinetics", "supercoiling", "thermal fluctuations"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T18:57:31", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1004"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "The assessment of the paleobiology and morphological affinities of the Neandertals and other Late Pleistocene archaic humans is central to resolving issues regarding the emergence and establishment of modern human morphology and diversity.

Understanding the complex EGFR regulatory network is critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. To this end, this work investigated the functions of two incompletely characterized regulators of EGFR trafficking and signaling, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) and Sprouty2 (SPRY2), in two cancer settings where EGFR mutation is common, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In NSCLC cells, results indicate that MIG6, an endogenous inhibitor of EGFR activity and endocytic adaptor, is surprisingly responsible for at least half of EGFR endocytosis, suggesting that a substantial fraction of internalized EGFR may not be competent to drive signaling. Computational modeling further suggested that in cells expressing kinase-activated, endocytosis-impaired EGFR mutants, the importance of MIG6 relative to other endocytic pathways is increased, but that MIG6 internalization capacity is reduced compared to cells expressing wild-type EGFR. Additional data indicate that SPRY2 expression reduces EGFR endocytosis rate primarily by promoting EGFR expression, which overwhelms the saturable EGFR endocytic pathway, but that SPRY2 also promotes ERK phosphorylation and resistance to EGFR inhibition independent of EGFR expression level. In GBM cell lines, our data demonstrate that SPRY2 expression promotes proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, resistance to EGFR and c-MET co-inhibition, and growth as mouse tumor xenografts. Additional studies identified SPRY2-mediated regulation of the strength and effects of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways as important for controlling GBM cell behaviors. Through analysis of public datasets and a collaborative analysis of human and rat tumors, we further found that elevated SPRY2 expression is associated with reduced patient survival and expression of EGFR variant III, an EGFR mutant linked to aggressive GBM. Thus, while SPRY2 is a candidate tumor suppressor in other contexts, our results support a tumor promoter role for SPRY2 in GBM and identify SPRY2 and the pathways it regulates as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for therapeutic response. Overall, these findings add new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the complexities of EGFR trafficking and signaling regulation and the functions of SPRY2 and MIG6 that may be leveraged to develop improved cancer therapies.", "contributors": [{"name": "Walsh, Alice Macdonald", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Walsh", "additionalName": "Macdonald", "givenName": "Alice", "email": ""}], "title": "Regulation of cell signaling by MIG6 and Sprouty2 in cancers with EGFR mutations", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1638", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2762&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2762"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["publication:be", "publication:edissertations", "publication:seas"]}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer", "drug resistance", "feedback", "cell biology", "biomedical", "computational modeling", "signaling"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T19:06:23", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1638"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "Plants sense long-wavelength and low-intensity UV-B light as a signal for the induction of photomorphogenesis.

Multiple mating takes time and energy. Thus, if females fertilize their eggs with a single mating, why to mate more than once? We investigated and inferred paternal identity and number of sires in 12 clutches (240 hatchlings) of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) nests at Tortuguero, Costa Rica. Paternal alleles were inferred through comparison of maternal and hatchling genotypes, and indicated multiple paternity in at least 11 of the clutches (92%). The inferred average number of fathers was three (ranging from 1 to 5). Moreover, regression analyses were used to investigate for correlation of inferred clutch paternity with morphological traits of hatchlings fitness (emergence success, length, weight and crawling speed), the size of the mother, and an environmental variable (incubation temperature). We suggest and propose two different comparative approaches for evaluating morphological traits and clutch paternity, in order to infer greater offspring survival. First, clutches coded by the exact number of fathers and second by the exact paternal contribution (fathers who gives greater proportion of the offspring per nest). We found significant differences (P < 0.05) in clutches coded by the exact number of fathers for all morphological traits. A general tendency of higher values in offspring sired by two to three fathers was observed for the length and weight traits. However, emergence success and crawling speed showed different trends which unable us to reach any further conclusion. The second approach analysing the paternal contribution showed no significant difference (P > 0.05) for any of the traits. We conclude that multiple paternity does not provide any extra benefit in the morphological fitness traits or the survival of the offspring, when analysed following the proposed comparative statistical methods.", "contributors": [{"name": "Alfaro-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Alonzo", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Alfaro-N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Alonzo", "email": ""}, {"name": "Jensen, Michael P.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Jensen", "additionalName": "P.", "givenName": "Michael", "email": ""}, {"name": "Abreu-Grobois, F.

The generation of novel cell lines and transgenic mouse models using this method necessitates the construction of a \u2018targeting\u2019 vector, which contains homologous DNA sequences to the target gene, and has for many years been a limiting step in the process. Vector construction can be performed in vivo in Escherichia coli cells using homologous recombination mediated by phage recombinases using a technique termed recombineering. Recombineering is the preferred technique to subclone the long homology sequences (>4kb) and various targeting elements including selection markers that are required to mediate efficient allelic exchange between a targeting vector and its cognate genomic locus. Typical recombineering protocols follow an iterative scheme of step-wise integration of the targeting elements and require intermediate purification and transformation steps. Here, we present a novel recombineering methodology of vector assembly using a multiplex approach. Plasmid gap repair is performed by the simultaneous capture of genomic sequence from mouse Bacterial Artificial Chromosome libraries and the insertion of dual bacterial and mammalian selection markers. This subcloning plus insertion method is highly efficient and yields a majority of correct recombinants. We present data for the construction of different types of conditional gene knockout, or knock-in, vectors and BAC reporter vectors that have been constructed using this method.

However, the low efficiency in generating iPS cells and the tendency of tumorigenesis hinder the therapeutic applications for iPS cells in treatment of human diseases. To this end, it remains largely unknown how the iPS process is subjected to regulation by upstream signaling pathway(s). Here, we report that Akt regulates the iPS process by modulating posttranslational modifications of these iPS factors in both direct and indirect manners. Specifically, Akt directly phosphorylates Oct4 to modulate the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer formation. Furthermore, Akt either facilitates the p300-mediated acetylation of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, or stabilizes Klf4 by inactivating GSK3, thus indirectly modulating stemness. As tumorigenesis shares possible common features and mechanisms with iPS, our study suggests that Akt inhibition might serve as a cancer therapeutic approach to target cancer stem cells.", "contributors": [{"name": "Dai, Xiangpeng", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Dai", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Xiangpeng", "email": ""}, {"name": "Liu, Pengda", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Liu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Pengda", "email": ""}, {"name": "Lau, Alan W", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lau", "additionalName": "W", "givenName": "Alan", "email": ""}, {"name": "Liu, Yueyong", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Liu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Yueyong", "email": ""}, {"name": "Inuzuka, Hiroyuki", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Inuzuka", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Hiroyuki", "email": ""}], "title": "Acetylation-dependent regulation of essential iPS-inducing factors: a regulatory crossroad for pluripotency and tumorigenesis", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-22T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302671"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that packages a single-stranded RNA pregenome (pgRNA).

Hammer\nT lymphocyte homing and migration is critical for host defense and immunity. T lymphocytes must be captured from blood flow, tether and roll on the endothelial surface, engage chemokine receptors, and firmly adhere and migrate to sites of inflammation or to secondary lymphoid organs. How adhesive ligands, soluble factors such as chemokines, and fluid shear flow influence the motility of T lymphocytes is important for understanding this dynamic cascade of events. In this thesis, primary human T lymphocyte motility was quantified on various adhesive ligands (haptokinesis) in the presence of chemokines (chemokinesis) and in response to fluid flow. Through the use of microcontact printing onto PDMS surfaces we created surfaces that presented ligand at controlled densities either alone or in combination. The adhesive ligands ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and fibronectin were used to quantify cell migration in the absence of chemokine revealing different modes of T lymphocyte motility with ICAM-1 having an overall greater contribution. Using the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL12, we demonstrated that motility is biphasic and is dependent upon ICAM-1 concentration, and by presenting chemokines in combination, we can drive motility to higher levels than what was seen with each chemokine individually. Finally we demonstrated that directed migration either upstream or downstream of fluid flow is dependent upon the presence of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or a combination of the two and the shear rate used. We have been able to show that adhesive ligands, chemokines, and shear flow all work in concert to promote robust primary human T lymphocyte adhesion and migration on microcontact printed PDMS surfaces. This research further elucidates how T lymphocytes interpret these signals for controlling homing to and motility within secondary lymphoid organs and the mechanisms of their migration.", "contributors": [{"name": "Dominguez, George Aaron", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Dominguez", "additionalName": "Aaron", "givenName": "George", "email": ""}], "title": "Effect of Substrate Ligand Presentation on the Motility of Human T-Lymphocytes", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1076", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2200&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2200"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["publication:be", "publication:edissertations", "publication:seas"]}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biomedical"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T18:58:25", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1076"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  We observed reptation of single DNA molecules in fused silica nanoslits of\nsub-30 nm height.

In this report, we show that this system undergoes regulation via ClaR, a novel activator protein from the RpiR family of transcriptional regulators. Although RpiR proteins are widely distributed among lactic acid bacteria, their roles have yet to be confirmed by functional assays.

Hematopoietic stem cells from PrP knockout mice have defects in self-renewal, as manifested during serial bone marrow transplantation or during the aging process. PrP knockout mice also display a slight reduction in cellular proliferation and/or neurogenesis in the adult brain. I also participated in the development of a video based behavior recognition system. We used this system to quantify the home cage behavioral changes in two mouse models of neurodegeneration, Huntington's disease and prion disease. Because studies of prion disease have been focused primary on the pathological level, I have attempted to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for mediating neurotoxicity in a mouse model of infectious prion disease. In the first series of studies we tested whether apoptotoic cell death pathways are activated in prion disease. We inoculated mice deficient for Caspase-12 and Bax, both of which have been implicated in mediating prion toxicity, but did not observe any protection against disease in these mice. Also, neuronal overexpression of Bcl-2 did not protect against prion toxicity and instead, inhibition of apoptosis may have enhanced several aspects of disease (as did deletion of Bax). In a second attempt at determining pathways involved in prion toxicity, I determined that deletion of heat shock factor 1 (Hsfl), a stress responsive transcription factor, protects against prion toxicity. Mice that are deficient for Hsfl succumb to prion disease faster than controls, despite similar pathological and behavioral onset.", "by Andrew D. Steele.", "Thesis (Ph.

We provide evidence for a non-apoptotic function of CED-3 caspase that regulates multiple developmental events through proteolytic inactivation.

A mutant JZ-1 strain, MJZ-1, defective in the degradation of 3-phenoxybenzoate was obtained by successive streaking on LB agar. Comparison of the draft genomes of strains JZ-1 and MJZ-1 revealed that a 29,366-bp DNA fragment containing a putative angular dioxygenase gene cluster (pbaA1A2B) is missing in strain MJZ-1. PbaA1, PbaA2, and PbaB share 65%, 52%, and 10% identity with the corresponding \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits and the ferredoxin component of dioxin dioxygenase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1, respectively. Complementation of pbaA1A2B in strain MJZ-1 resulted in the active 3-phenoxybenzoate 1\u2032,2\u2032-dioxygenase, but the enzyme activity in Escherichia coli was achieved only through the coexpression of pbaA1A2B and a glutathione reductase (GR)-type reductase gene, pbaC, indicating that the 3-phenoxybenzoate 1\u2032,2\u2032-dioxygenase belongs to a type IV Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenase system consisting of a hetero-oligomeric oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin, and a GR-type reductase. The pbaC gene is not located in the immediate vicinity of pbaA1A2B. 3-Phenoxybenzoate 1\u2032,2\u2032-dioxygenase catalyzes the hydroxylation in the 1\u2032 and 2\u2032 positions of the benzene moiety of 3-phenoxybenzoate, yielding 3-hydroxybenzoate and catechol. Transcription of pbaA1A2B and pbaC was induced by 3-phenoxybenzoate, but the transcriptional level of pbaC was far less than that of pbaA1A2B, implying the possibility that PbaC may not be the only reductase that can physiologically transfer electrons to PbaA1A2B in strain JZ-1.

However, the spindle\u2019s response to a stretching force acting at the spindle pole and along its long axis, i.e., the direction in which chromosomes are segregated, has not been examined. Here, we describe a method to apply a stretching force to the metaphase spindle assembled in Xenopus egg extracts and measure the relationship between the force and the three-dimensional deformation of the spindle. We found that the spindle behaves as a Zener-type viscoelastic body when forces are applied at the spindle pole, generating a restoring force for several minutes.

However, the abnormal expression of any given imprinted gene did not correlate with abnormal expression at any other loci or with the various cloning phenotypes. Thus, imprinted gene expression appeared stochastically affected in the clones and some abnormalities in gene expression could be traced to the donor ES cell populations. To determine whether abnormal gene expression extended beyond the examined imprinted genes, we assessed global gene expression by microarray analysis on RNA from the placentas and livers of neonatal cloned mice. This analysis allowed us to determine whether differences in gene expression existed between different types of donor cells. Direct comparison of gene expression profiles of over 10,000 genes in ES cell and cumulus cells NT mice showed that in clones derived from both donor cell types approximately 4% of the expressed genes in the placentas differed dramatically from those in controls and that the majority of abnormally expressed genes were common to both types of clones. Importantly, however, the expression of a smaller subset of genes differed between the ES cell and cumulus cell derived clones. The livers of the cloned mice also showed abnormal gene expression although to a lesser extent, and with a different set of affected genes, than seen in the placentas. Our results demonstrate frequent abnormal gene expression in clones, in which many expression abnormalities appear common to the nuclear transfer procedure while others appear to reflect the particular donor nucleus. Surprisingly, many clones survived neonatally despite widespread gene dysregulation, indicating that mammalian development can tolerate many epigenetic abnormalities.", "by David G.

Our goal is to develop zebrafish as an alternative system to the mammalian heart model for the study of the structure of the cardiac thick filaments and the proteins that form it. We have successfully isolated thick filaments from zebrafish cardiac muscle, using a procedure similar to those for mammalian heart, and analyzed their structure by negative-staining and electron microscopy. The isolated filaments appear well ordered with the characteristic 42.9\u00a0nm quasi-helical repeat of the myosin heads expected from x-ray diffraction. We have performed single particle image analysis on the collected electron microscopy images for the C-zone region of these filaments and obtained a three-dimensional reconstruction at 3.5\u00a0nm resolution. This reconstruction reveals structure similar to the mammalian thick filament, and demonstrates that zebrafish may provide a useful model for the study of the changes in the cardiac thick filament associated with disease processes.", "contributors": [{"name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00e1, Maryv\u00ed", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00e1", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Maryv\u00ed", "email": ""}, {"name": "AL-Khayat, Hind\u00a0A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "AL-Khayat", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Hind", "email": ""}, {"name": "Behra, Martine", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Behra", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Martine", "email": ""}, {"name": "Kensler, Robert\u00a0W.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Kensler", "additionalName": "W.", "givenName": "Robert", "email": ""}], "title": "Zebrafish Cardiac Muscle Thick Filaments: Isolation Technique and Three-Dimensional Structure", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["motors and nanoscale biophysics", "molecular machines"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-15T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008832"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "MyJove Corporation"}, "description": "Leukocyte-endothelial interactions are early and critical events in acute and chronic inflammation and can, when dysregulated, mediate tissue injury leading to permanent pathological damage.

This requires the blood to undergo several steps before peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) can be ready for analysis, which in turn can stimulate PBLs influencing the research findings. The autoperfused micro flow chamber assay, however, allows scientists to study early leukocytes functional dysregulation using the systemic flow of a live mouse while having the freedom of manipulating a coated chamber. Through a disease model, the functional expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules can be assessed and quantified in a micro-glass chamber coated with immobilized endothelial adhesion molecules ex vivo. In this model, the blood flows between the right common carotid artery and left external jugular vein of a live mouse under anesthesia, allowing the interaction of native PBLs in the chamber. Real-time experimental analysis is achieved with the assistance of an intravital microscope as well as a Harvard Apparatus pressure device. The application of a flow regulator at the input point of the glass chamber allows comparable physiological flow conditions amongst the experiments. Leukocyte rolling velocity is the main outcome and is measured using the National Institutes of Health open-access software ImageJ.

Catalase is present in some strictly anaerobic methane-producing archaea (methanogens), but the importance of catalase to the antioxidant system of methanogens is poorly understood. We report here that a survey of the sequenced genomes of methanogens revealed that the majority of species lack genes encoding catalase. Moreover, Methanosarcina acetivorans is a methanogen capable of synthesizing haem and encodes haem-dependent catalase in its genome; yet, Methanosarcina acetivorans cells lack detectable catalase activity. However, inducible expression of the haem-dependent catalase from Escherichia coli (EcKatG) in the chromosome of Methanosarcina acetivorans resulted in a 100-fold increase in the endogenous catalase activity compared with uninduced cells. The increased catalase activity conferred a 10-fold increase in the resistance of EcKatG-induced cells to H2O2 compared with uninduced cells. The EcKatG-induced cells were also able to grow when exposed to levels of H2O2 that inhibited or killed uninduced cells. However, despite the significant increase in catalase activity, growth studies revealed that EcKatG-induced cells did not exhibit increased tolerance to O2 compared with uninduced cells. These results support the lack of catalase in the majority of methanogens, since methanogens are more likely to encounter O2 rather than high concentrations of H2O2 in the natural environment. Catalase appears to be a minor component of the antioxidant system in methanogens, even those that are aerotolerant, including Methanosarcina acetivorans.

During the treatment with cisplatin, NAC led to lower levels of p53, which may have partially contributed to increased cell survival. However, in contrast to NO, NAC did not significantly alter the effects of cisplatin upon MiTF and apoptotic proteins studied.

Non-random associations between paternal phenotype and offspring viability may thus affect total selection on sexually selected traits. Long-term data on wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) provide the first evidence in nature that association between paternal phenotype and lamb viability strengthens total selection on horn size of adult rams, a sexually selected trait. The association of paternal horn length and offspring viability was sexually antagonistic: long-horned males sired sons with high viability but daughters of low viability.

The vast heterogeneity of immune cells motivates the study of these interactions at the single-cell level. In this thesis, we present new tools to characterize how individual immune cells interact with each other and with diseased cells. We develop a nanowell-based platform to investigate how natural killer (NK) cells interrogate and attack diseased target cells. This platform enables integrated analysis of cytolytic activity, secretory activity, receptor expression, and dynamic parameters of interactions between thousands of individual NK cells and target cells. Using this platform, we show that NK cells operate independently when lysing a single target and that motility during contact is associated with the secretion of certain cytokines. Extending the platform, we investigate how contact with a target induces the shedding of CD16 from the surface of an NK cell. NK cells use CD16 to recognize antibody-coated target cells, and thus the loss of CD16 is of clinical interest. We show that the loss of CD16 is correlated to the length of time that the NK cell spends in contact with a target but that not all NK cells that shed CD16 exert common effector functions. In wells with multiple NK cells, shedding occurs in a more coordinated manner than would be expected by chance alone. Next, we compare the functional properties of NK cells with distinct repertoires of inhibitory receptors. Inhibitory receptors prevent NK cells from attacking healthy cells, and their expression can confer NK cells with increased functional activity in a process known as \"licensing\". We show that despite forming prolonged contacts with target cells, unlicensed NK cells are less likely than licensed NK cells to secrete cytokines.

The vast heterogeneity of immune cells motivates the study of these interactions at the single-cell level. In this thesis, we present new tools to characterize how individual immune cells interact with each other and with diseased cells. We develop a nanowell-based platform to investigate how natural killer (NK) cells interrogate and attack diseased target cells. This platform enables integrated analysis of cytolytic activity, secretory activity, receptor expression, and dynamic parameters of interactions between thousands of individual NK cells and target cells. Using this platform, we show that NK cells operate independently when lysing a single target and that motility during contact is associated with the secretion of certain cytokines. Extending the platform, we investigate how contact with a target induces the shedding of CD16 from the surface of an NK cell. NK cells use CD16 to recognize antibody-coated target cells, and thus the loss of CD16 is of clinical interest. We show that the loss of CD16 is correlated to the length of time that the NK cell spends in contact with a target but that not all NK cells that shed CD16 exert common effector functions. In wells with multiple NK cells, shedding occurs in a more coordinated manner than would be expected by chance alone. Next, we compare the functional properties of NK cells with distinct repertoires of inhibitory receptors. Inhibitory receptors prevent NK cells from attacking healthy cells, and their expression can confer NK cells with increased functional activity in a process known as \"licensing\". We show that despite forming prolonged contacts with target cells, unlicensed NK cells are less likely than licensed NK cells to secrete cytokines. Finally, we present tools to study other modes of interaction between immune cells. Towards this end, we develop and apply fluorescent cellular barcoding strategies to efficiently analyze the secretory properties of individual immune cells from different populations.

Avoiding aggregation of partially folded intermediates during intracellular folding remains a viable explanation for the rarity of long hydrophobic runs in soluble proteins. Comparison between database editions reveals robustness of statistics on aqueous proteins despite an approximately twofold increase in nonredundant sequences. The expanded database does now allow us to explain several deviations of hydrophobicity statistics from models of random sequence in terms of requirements of specific secondary structure elements. Comparison to prior membrane-bound protein sequences, however, shows significant qualitative changes, with the average hydrophobicity and frequency of long runs of hydrophobic residues noticeably increasing between the database editions. These results suggest that the aqueous proteins of solved structure may represent an essentially complete sample of the universe of aqueous sequences, while the membrane proteins of known structure are not yet representative of the universe of membrane-associated proteins, even by relatively simple measures of hydrophobic patterns."}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biology", "protein structure", "computational biology", "models", "sequence analysis", "chemical", "structure-activity relationship", "hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions", "statistical", "databases", "protein", "tertiary", "secondary"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2014-10-24T21:00:32", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.cmu.edu/biology/434"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "For cells and organisms to survive, they must maintain protein homeostasis in varied and often harsh environments.

Furthermore, I report that NusA in addition to having a role in transcription elongation is also important for promoting survival after DNA damage. Phenotypes of nusA mutants are more exaggerated than those of TLS polymerase mutants. Genetic interactions of nusA+ with the nucleotide excision repair pathway suggest that nusA+ may play a role in a new class of NusA-dependent transcription coupled repair. Moreover, I have isolated RNA polymerase mutants with altered ability to survive after DNA damage, and this altered ability is absolutely dependent on nusA+ and uvrA+. The completion of translesion DNA synthesis requires both the insertion of a nucleotide opposite the adducted template base and extension from that position by several subsequent nucleotide additions. We present evidence that DinB is specialized to perform strikingly proficient extension after insertion opposite an N2-dG lesion.

Absence of hevin results in a profound, long-lasting reduction in thalamocortical synapses accompanied by a transient increase in intracortical excitatory connections. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cortical neurons from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) revealed that, during early postnatal development, dendritic spines often receive multiple excitatory inputs. Immuno-EM and confocal analyses revealed that majority of the spines with multiple excitatory contacts (SMECs) receive simultaneous thalamic and cortical inputs.

This study reports on using a novel sponge-type, Ti2-coated biofilm carrier that shows significant adherence of Ti2 to its exterior and the ability to accumulate biomass in its interior (protected from UV light and free radicals). First, this carrier was tested for ICPB in a continuous-flow photocatalytic circulating-bed biofilm reactor (PCBBR) to mineralize biorecalcitrant organic: 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP). Four mechanisms possibly acting of ICPB were tested separately: TCP adsorption, UV photolysis/photocatalysis, and biodegradation. The carrier exhibited strong TCP adsorption, while photolysis was negligible. Photocatalysis produced TCP-degradation products that could be mineralized and the strong adsorption of TCP to the carrier enhanced biodegradation by relieving toxicity. Validating the ICPB concept, biofilm was protected inside the carriers from UV light and free radicals.

This study reports on using a novel sponge-type, Ti2-coated biofilm carrier that shows significant adherence of Ti2 to its exterior and the ability to accumulate biomass in its interior (protected from UV light and free radicals). First, this carrier was tested for ICPB in a continuous-flow photocatalytic circulating-bed biofilm reactor (PCBBR) to mineralize biorecalcitrant organic: 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP). Four mechanisms possibly acting of ICPB were tested separately: TCP adsorption, UV photolysis/photocatalysis, and biodegradation. The carrier exhibited strong TCP adsorption, while photolysis was negligible. Photocatalysis produced TCP-degradation products that could be mineralized and the strong adsorption of TCP to the carrier enhanced biodegradation by relieving toxicity. Validating the ICPB concept, biofilm was protected inside the carriers from UV light and free radicals. ICPB significantly lowered the diversity of the bacterial community, but five genera known to biodegrade chlorinated phenols were markedly enriched.

In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the pre-Replicative Complex (pre-RC) associates with ORC at the origin, priming the origin for initiation of DNA replication. Upon entry into S phase, the pre-RC is activated by the combined activities of two protein kinases, the S phase specific Dbf4 Dependent Kinase (DDK) Cdc7 and the Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) Cdc28. After the origin initiates or is replicated over in S phase, a complex called the post-replicative Complex (post-RC) is left at the origin until CDK levels drop and pre-RCs reform in the next G1. In this work, both the cis acting sequences necessary at the origin to form pre-RCs and the trans acting proteins that regulate pre-RC formation were studied. Along with an essential ORC binding site, the well characterized yeast origin ARS1 requires specific sequences at an auxiliary sequence element, the B2 element, to load pre-RCs. These sequences resemble an extra ORC binding site, but do not bind a second ORC in vitro. Mutations in these sequences are rescued by overexpression of the pre-RC component Cdc6. Together, these results suggest that one of the proteins in the pre-RC interacts with this DNA sequence to facilitate complex formation. An interaction between the smallest subunit of ORC, Orc6, and the S phase cyclin Clb5 was documented. The molecular domains responsible for this interaction are a hydrophobic patch on Clb5 and an RXL motif and CDK phosphorylation sites on Orc6. Clb5 associates stably with origins after they replicate, forming part of the post-RC. This interaction aids in prevention of re-replication within a single cell cycle.", "by Gwendolyn M.

After a single ptDNA strand has wrapped the QD, additional strands are excluded from the surface. Production of mQDs in this manner can be accomplished at small and large scale, with commercial reagents, and in minimal steps. These mQDs can be specifically directed to biological targets by hybridization to a complementary single stranded targeting DNA. We demonstrate the use of these mQDs as imaging probes by labeling SNAP-tagged Notch receptors on live mammalian cells, targeted by mQDs bearing a benzylguanine moiety.

We present a simple analytical model to address the\nresulting inference biases, and develop an exact method accounting for\nbackground correlations in alignment data by combining phylogenetic modeling\nwith an adaptive cluster expansion algorithm. We find that popular reweighting\nschemes are only marginally effective at removing phylogenetic bias, suggest a\nrescaling strategy that yields better results, and provide evidence that our\nconclusions carry over to the frequently used mean-field approach to the\ninverse Ising problem.\n", "Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures; accepted at New J Phys"]}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["condensed matter - disordered systems and neural networks", "condensed matter - statistical mechanics", "quantitative biology - populations and evolution"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2014-12-10T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8703"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "The liver regulates a myriad of vital functions including bile acid synthesis, hepatobiliary circulation, cholesterol homeostasis, drug metabolism, etc. This thesis focuses on the use of a 3D in vitro model of liver to study the effects of compounds and culture conditions on hepatobiliary transport and bile acid synthesis.

In particular, this thesis has focused on determining the regulation of the translesion polymerase Revl in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The REV1 gene is responsible for the vast majority of spontaneous and damage-induced mutagenesis in all eukaryotes, from unicellular yeast to multicellular humans. Thus, an understanding the regulation and molecular mechanisms of REV1 activity will provide critical insight into the processes of mutagenesis underlying disease and evolution. The studies described here provide evidence supporting a new model of translesion synthesis, based on the observation of the cell-cycle regulation of the Revs protein. Additionally, mutations in conserved motifs in Revl have allowed characterization of the protein-protein interactions critical for REV1 activity in survival and mutagenesis. Taken together, the data presented here argue for a cellular response mediated through Rev regulation which temporally and spatially restricts potentially mutagenic translesion synthesis such that it is employed only when necessary.", "by Lauren S.

In particular, discreet RNA regulatory elements were shown to allow to selective translation of specific mRNAs, which typically encode for proteins required for a particular stress response. Identification of these mRNAs, as well as the characterization of regulatory mechanisms responsible for selective translation has been at the forefront of molecular biology for some time. Polysome profiling is a cornerstone method in these studies. The goal of polysome profiling is to capture mRNA translation by immobilizing actively translating ribosomes on different transcripts and separate the resulting polyribosomes by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, thus allowing for a distinction between highly translated transcripts and poorly translated ones. These can then be further characterized by traditional biochemical and molecular biology methods. Importantly, combining polysome profiling with high throughput genomic approaches allows for a large scale analysis of translational regulation.", "contributors": [{"name": "Faye, Mame Daro", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Faye", "additionalName": "Daro", "givenName": "Mame", "email": ""}, {"name": "Graber, Tyson E", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Graber", "additionalName": "E", "givenName": "Tyson", "email": ""}, {"name": "Holcik, Martin", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Holcik", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Martin", "email": ""}], "title": "Assessment of Selective mRNA Translation in Mammalian Cells by Polysome Profiling", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cellular biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-12T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4353390"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Blackwell Publishing Ltd"}, "description": "Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) in a proportion of tumors. HPV-positive OPSCC is considered a distinct molecular entity with a prognostic advantage compared to HPV-negative cases. Silencing of cancer-related genes by DNA promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in the development of OPSCC. Hence, we examined promoter methylation status in 24 common tumor suppressor genes in a group of 200 OPSCCs to determine differentially methylated genes in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative primary OPSCC. Methylation status was correlated with HPV status, clinical features, and patient survival using multivariate methods. Additionally, methylation status of 16 cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) was compared with HPV-positive OPSCC. Using methylation-specific probe amplification, HPV-positive OPSCC showed a significantly higher cumulative methylation index (CMI) compared to HPV-negative OPSCC (P=0.008). For the genes CDH13, DAPK1, and RARB, both HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC showed promoter hypermethylation in at least 20% of the tumors. HPV status was found to be an independent predictor of promoter hypermethylation of CADM1 (P < 0.001), CHFR (P = 0.027), and TIMP3 (P < 0.001). CADM1 and CHFR showed similar methylation patterns in OPSCC and cervical SCC, but TIMP3 showed no methylation in cervical SCC in contrast to OPSCC. Methylation status of neither individual gene nor CMI was associated with survival. These results suggest that HPV-positive tumors are to a greater extent driven by promotor hypermethylation in these tumor suppressor genes. Especially CADM1 and TIMP3 are significantly more frequently hypermethylated in HPV-positive OPSCC and CHFR in HPV-negative tumors.", "contributors": [{"name": "van Kempen, Pauline M W", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "van Kempen", "additionalName": "M W", "givenName": "Pauline", "email": ""}, {"name": "van Bockel, Liselotte", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "van Bockel", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Liselotte", "email": ""}, {"name": "Braunius, Weibel W", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Braunius", "additionalName": "W", "givenName": "Weibel", "email": ""}, {"name": "Moelans, Cathy B", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Moelans", "additionalName": "B", "givenName": "Cathy", "email": ""}, {"name": "van Olst, Marina", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "van Olst", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Marina", "email": ""}, {"name": "de Jong, Rick", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "de Jong", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Rick", "email": ""}, {"name": "Stegeman, Inge", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Stegeman", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Inge", "email": ""}, {"name": "van Diest, Paul J", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "van Diest", "additionalName": "J", "givenName": "Paul", "email": ""}, {"name": "Grolman, Wilko", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Grolman", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Wilko", "email": ""}, {"name": "Willems, Stefan M", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Willems", "additionalName": "M", "givenName": "Stefan", "email": ""}], "title": "HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with TIMP3 and CADM1 promoter hypermethylation", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-22T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302669"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become an important tool to characterize and image surfaces with nanoscale resolution.

I further demonstrated that mice immunized with intimin significantly reduced time of the E. coli O157:H7 shedding in their feces after the challenge with these bacteria, as compared to unimmunized mice. Shiga toxin is the major virulence factor that contributes to HUS. Since Shiga toxin B subunit has an important role in the attachment of the toxin to its receptor, I fused intimin to Shiga toxin B subunit to create multivalent subunit vaccine and tested the effects upon immunization of mice with the B subunit when combined with intimin. His-tagged intimin, Shiga toxin B subunit, and Shiga toxin-intimin fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. I demonstrated that this multivalent fusion protein vaccine candidate elicited intimin- and Shiga toxin B-specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA antibodies in mice. I also showed a reduction in the duration of the bacterial shedding after the challenge compared to the control sham-immunized groups.", "Dissertation/Thesis", "Ph.D. Plant Biology 2010"]}}, {"name": "relation", "properties": {"relation": []}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["collections:7", "research"]}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": "All Rights Reserved"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.I.8758", "item:8758"]}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cow", "intimin", "shiga toxin", "ehec", "plant biology", "vaccine"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-12T01:08:07", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.I.8758"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "Among mammals, only primates can accumulate high levels of xanthophyll carotenoids in their retinas.

We have further shown that although pocket proteins are known to interact with histone deacetylases, in C. elegans the synMuv protein HDA-1 HDAC1 is not a component of the DRM complex although it is component of a NuRD-like complex. Furthermore, the NuRD-like complex has functions distinct from the DRM complex in vulval development. We have also characterized the class B synMuv protein LIN-61, which is not a core member of either the DRM or NuRD-like complexes. LIN-61 contains four malignant brain tumor (MBT) repeats, which are in multiple transcriptional repressors. Thus like other class B synMuv proteins, LIN-61 likely functions to repress transcription of genes that induce vulval development. Our biochemical and genetic characterizations of the synMuv genes have identified a new pocket protein-containing complex and have demonstrated the existence of multiple complexes among the class B synMuv proteins.

I have found that the N-domain is necessary for activity of the ClpX adaptor protein RssB in degradation of [sigma]. I have also found that the N-domain plays a differential role in degradation of ClpXP substrates, it is necessary for efficient degradation of protein substrates containing all of the recognition signals except C-motif 1. The N-domain was not necessary for degradation of N-motif 1 and N-motif 2 peptide substrates, which unlike protein substrates do not need to be unfolded during degradation. Thus suggesting that the N-domain is involved in steps following binding, that is, unfolding and/or translocation. I have shown that ClpXP can efficiently degrade proteins containing a disulfide-bond. This suggests that the ClpXP channel can expand to [approx.] 20-25A [Angstroms], since translocation of an intact disulfide bond requires simultaneous translocation of two, if not three, polypeptide chains.

Detection and quantification of these short-T2 species is of considerable clinical and scientific interest. Cortical bone water and myelin are two of the most important tissue constituents. Quantification of cortical bone water concentration allows for indirect estimation of bone pore volume and noninvasive assessment of bone quality. Myelin is essential for the proper functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Direct assessment of myelin would reveal CNS abnormalities and enhance our understanding of neurological diseases.\nHowever, conventional MRI with echo times of several milliseconds or longer is unable to detect these short-lived MR signals. Recent advances in MRI technology and hardware have enabled development of a number of short-T2 imaging techniques, key among which are ultra-short echo time (UTE) imaging, zero echo time (ZTE) imaging, and sweep imaging with Fourier transform (SWIFT). While these pulse sequences are able to detect short-T2 species, they still suffer from signal interference between different T2 tissue constituents, image artifacts and excessive scan time. These are primary technical hurdles for application to whole-body clinical scanners. In this thesis research, new MRI techniques for improving short-T2 tissue imaging have been developed to address these challenges with a focus on direct detection and quantification of cortical bone water and myelin on a clinical MRI scanner.\nThe first focus of this research was to optimize long-T2 suppression in UTE imaging. Saturation and adiabatic RF pulses were designed to achieve maximum long-T2 suppression while maximizing the signal from short-T2 species. The imaging protocols were optimized by Bloch equation simulations and were validated using phantom and in vivo experiments. The results show excellent short-T2 contrast with these optimized pulse sequences.\nThe problem of blurring artifacts resulting from the inhomogeneous excitation profile of the rectangular pulses in ZTE imaging was addressed. The proposed approach involves quadratic phase-modulated RF excitation and iterative solution of an inverse problem formulated from the signal model of ZTE imaging and is shown to effectively remove the image artifacts.\nSubsequently image acquisition efficiency was improved in order to attain clinically-feasible scan times. To accelerate the acquisition speed in UTE and ZTE imaging, compressed sensing was applied with a hybrid 3D UTE sequence. Further, the pulse sequence and reconstruction procedure were modified to enable anisotropic field-of-view shape conforming to the geometry of the elongated imaged object.\nThese enhanced acquisition techniques were applied to the detection and quantification of cortical bone water. A new biomarker, the suppression ratio (a ratio image derived from two UTE images, one without and the other with long-T2 suppression), was conceived as a surrogate measure of cortical bone porosity. Experimental data suggest the suppression ratio may be a more direct measure of porosity than previously measured total bone water concentration.\nLastly, the feasibility of directly detecting and quantifying spatially-resolved myelin concentration with a clinical imager was explored, both theoretically and experimentally. Bloch equation simulations were conducted to investigate the intrinsic image resolution and the fraction of detectable myelin signal under current scanner hardware constraints. The feasibility of quantitative ZTE imaging of myelin extract and lamb spinal cord at 3T was demonstrated.\nThe technological advances achieved in this dissertation research may facilitate translation of short-T2 MRI methods from the laboratory to the clinic.", "contributors": [{"name": "Li, Cheng", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Li", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Cheng", "email": ""}], "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Short-T2 Tissues with Applications for Quantifying Cortical Bone Water and Myelin", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1499", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2623&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2623"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["publication:be", "publication:edissertations", "publication:seas"]}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["radiology", "myelin", "short t2 relaxation time", "bone water", "zero echo time", "biomedical", "magnetic resonance imaging", "ultrashort echo time"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T19:04:23", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1499"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Research Showcase @ CMU"}, "description": "Eukaryotic ribosomal proteins are required for production of stable ribosome assembly intermediates and mature ribosomes, but more specific roles for these proteins in biogenesis of ribosomes are not known.

The thesis project investigates regulations of apoptosis in a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, HT-29, exposed to diverse cellular stimuli, focusing on a specific protein as well as global level of proteins. The first part of the thesis demonstrated S-nitrosation of procaspase-9. S-nitrosation is a novel protein modification to regulate protein-protein interaction or protein activity. This modification has been implied to inactivate caspases. We could visualize S-nitrosation of an initiator caspase, procaspase-9, by enriching low-abundant procaspase-9 with immunoprecipitation and stabilizing S-nitroso-cysteine with biotin labeling. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) reduced the S-nitrosation level of procaspase-9, suggesting that S-nitrosation may be regulated by a nitric oxide synthase and denitrosation is likely a mechanism of apoptosis. The second part of the thesis is to examine survival effects of insulin on cells undergoing TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis. Insulin decreased the TNF-\u03b1-induced cleavage of key apoptotic mediators, caspases, and their substrates as well as apoptosis, in part, depending on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. One of protective mechanisms by insulin is likely to decrease the TNF-\u03b1-induced dissociation of a potent inhibitor of caspases, X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), from procaspase-9 via PI-3K/Akt pathway. Lack of phosphoproteomics data in HT-29 cells led the third part of the thesis to focus on investigating global level regulation of phosphoproteins during apoptosis.

Helical peptide\nstructures exclude a smaller volume to water, relative to non-helical\nstructures with both the water models, but the total system volume for helical\nconformations is higher than non-helical conformations with TIP3P water at low\nto intermediate pressures, in contrast to TIP4P/2005 water. Our results further\nemphasize the importance of using an accurate water model to study protein\nfolding under conditions away from standard temperature and pressure.\n", "Comment: Main text + SI included"]}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["condensed matter - soft condensed matter", "physics - biological physics", "quantitative biology - biomolecules"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-13T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03716"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Society for Leukocyte Biology"}, "description": "Heparanase rs4693608 SNP discrepancy between recipients and donors correlates with post transplantation engraftment and risk of acute GVHD.", "contributors": [{"name": "Ostrovsky, Olga", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ostrovsky", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Olga", "email": ""}, {"name": "Shimoni, Avichai", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Shimoni", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Avichai", "email": ""}, {"name": "Baryakh, Polina", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Baryakh", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Polina", "email": ""}, {"name": "Morgulis, Yan", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Morgulis", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Yan", "email": ""}, {"name": "Mayorov, Margarita", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Mayorov", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Margarita", "email": ""}, {"name": "Beider, Katia", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Beider", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Katia", "email": ""}, {"name": "Shteingauz, Anna", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Shteingauz", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Anna", "email": ""}, {"name": "Ilan, Neta", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ilan", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Neta", "email": ""}, {"name": "Vlodavsky, Israel", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Vlodavsky", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Israel", "email": ""}, {"name": "Nagler, Arnon", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Nagler", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Arnon", "email": ""}], "title": "Modification of heparanase gene expression in response to conditioning and LPS treatment: strong correlation to rs4693608 SNP", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["systems biology & immunogenetics"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046248"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "Chemotherapeutic regimens involve the systemic administration of genotoxic compounds that induce cancer cell death via well-established DNA damage response signaling networks.

Many of these rangelands are also home to populations of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Our study aimed to compare the vegetation composition of an urban and exurban rangeland, and explore the role that prairie dogs play in these systems. The percent absolute canopy cover of graminoids (grasses and grass-likes), forbs, shrubs, litter, and bare ground were estimated at sampling areas located on and off prairie dog colonies at an urban and an exurban site. Herbaceous forage quality and quantity were determined on plant material collected from exclosure cages located on the colony during the entire growing season, while a relative estimate of prairie dog density was calculated using maximum counts. The exurban site had more litter and plant cover and less bare ground than the urban site. Graminoids were the dominant vegetation at the exurban plots. In contrast, mostly introduced forbs were found on the urban prairie dog colony. However, the forage quality and quantity tests demonstrated no difference between the two colonies. The relative prairie dog density was greater at the urban colony, which has the potential to drive greater vegetation utilization and reduced cover. Exurban rangeland showed lower levels of impact and retained all of the plant functional groups both on- and off-colony. These results suggest that activities of prairie dogs might further exacerbate the impacts of humans in fragmented urban rangeland habitats. Greater understanding of the drivers of these impacts and the spatial scales at which they occur are likely to prove valuable in the management and conservation of rangelands in and around urban areas.", "contributors": [{"name": "Hopson, Rebecca", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hopson", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Rebecca", "email": ""}, {"name": "Meiman, Paul", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Meiman", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Paul", "email": ""}, {"name": "Shannon, Graeme", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Shannon", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Graeme", "email": ""}], "title": "Rangeland dynamics: investigating vegetation composition and structure of urban and exurban prairie dog habitat", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["conservation biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-03T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4314087"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  We show that a mesoscale model, with a minimal number of parameters, can well\ndescribe the thermomechanical and mechanochemical behavior of homogeneous DNA\nat thermal equilibrium under tension and torque.

Recent studies have suggested that PPAR-\u03b4 agonists exert vascular protective effects. The present study was designed to characterize vascular function in mice with genetic inactivation of PPAR-\u03b4 in the endothelium. Mice with vascular endothelial cell-specific deletion of the PPAR-\u03b4 gene (ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice) were generated using loxP/Cre technology. ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice were normotensive and did not display any sign of metabolic syndrome. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to ACh and endothelium-independent relaxations to the nitric oxide (NO) donor diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate were both significantly impaired in the aorta and carotid arteries of ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.05). In ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mouse aortas, phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase at Ser1177 was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). However, basal levels of cGMP were unexpectedly increased (P < 0.05). Enzymatic activity of GTP-cyclohydrolase I and tetrahydrobiopterin levels were also enhanced in ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.05). Most notably, endothelium-specific deletion of the PPAR-\u03b4 gene significantly decreased protein expressions of catalase and glutathione peroxidase 1 and resulted in increased levels of H2O2 in the aorta (P < 0.05). In contrast, superoxide anion production was unaltered. Moreover, treatment with catalase prevented the endothelial dysfunction and elevation of cGMP detected in aortas of ePPAR\u03b4\u2212/\u2212 mice. The findings suggest that increased levels of cGMP caused by H2O2 impair vasodilator reactivity to endogenous and exogenous NO. We speculate that chronic elevation of H2O2 predisposes PPAR-\u03b4-deficient arteries to oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction.", "contributors": [{"name": "d'Uscio, Livius V.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "d'Uscio", "additionalName": "V.", "givenName": "Livius", "email": ""}, {"name": "He, Tongrong", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "He", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Tongrong", "email": ""}, {"name": "Santhanam, Anantha Vijay R.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Santhanam", "additionalName": "Vijay R.", "givenName": "Anantha", "email": ""}, {"name": "Tai, Li-Jung", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Tai", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Li-Jung", "email": ""}, {"name": "Evans, Ronald M.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Evans", "additionalName": "M.", "givenName": "Ronald", "email": ""}, {"name": "Katusic, Zvonimir S.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Katusic", "additionalName": "S.", "givenName": "Zvonimir", "email": ""}], "title": "Mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in mice with endothelium-specific deletion of the PPAR-\u03b4 gene", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["vascular biology and microcirculation"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962632"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "Thesis. 1977.

The desire is to differentiate among diseased and healthy cells, cell age, and cell type with the minimum amount of sample pretreatment. This project addresses this need by developing microfluidic devices that exploit the adhesion differences between cell states and cell types to rapidly count cells of different types without the need for labels. There are two avenues in which to explore cell adhesion differences with these devices, the first is a net electrostatic change at the surface of the cell wall and the second is the presence of specific cell-membrane adhesion proteins. It is hypothesized that the forced interaction of the cell wall with the microfabricated microcapillary walls would result in a differential velocity based on cell type that could be detected simply using a microscope and video camera or an interferometer. The eventual integration of cell velocity detection would result in a portable all-inclusive lab-on-a-chip system that could be used in the field for detecting the presence of diseases, such as malaria and cancer as well as in a lab setting for drug discovery.", "by Kristen M.

This thesis overviews the design of a molecular sensor to measure cellular forces and a hydrogel system to engineer angiogenic sprouting. We developed molecular force probes (FPs) that report traction forces of adherent cells with high spatial resolution, can be linked to virtually any surface, and do not require monitoring deformations of elastic substrates. FPs consist of DNA hairpins conjugated to fluorophore-quencher pairs that unfold and fluoresce when subjected to specific amounts of force. In chapter two we overview the synthetic strategies to produce these FPs from solid-state synthesis. We then demonstrate the chemical and physical characterization of these FPs. These data show that the FPs can be designed rationally from existing knowledge of the force-responsiveness of DNA hairpins. Chapter three summarizes our methods to affix these FPs to solid substrates to measure cellular traction forces. The silane chemistry to conjugate these FPs to glass coverslips is reported in detail. Then, the results of converting the fluorescence of these FPs to force values is given along with biological validation. We find using this method that cellular tractions are exerted at the distal ends of focal adhesions. In chapter four we present a versatile bioactive PEG hydrogel to study angiogenesis. This material is MMP-degradable and cell-adhesive.

RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous mechanism to regulate gene expression and it could serve as the basis of regulating aberrant proteins including cell cycle proteins. Since the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a main barrier for implementation of RNAi therapy, we explored the potential of a non-viral delivery system, 2.0\u2009kDa polyethylenimines substituted with linoleic acid and caprylic acid, for this purpose. Using a library of siRNAs against cell cycle proteins, we identified cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20), a recombinase RAD51, and serine\u2013threonine protein kinase CHEK1 as effective targets for breast cancer therapy, and demonstrated their therapeutic potential in breast cancer MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cells with respect to another well-studied cell cycle protein, kinesin spindle protein. We also explored the efficacy of dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA) against CDC20, RAD51, and CHEK1, where a particular DsiRNA against CDC20 showed an exceptionally high inhibition of cell growth in vitro. There was no apparent effect of silencing selected cell cycle proteins on the potency of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. The efficacy of DsiRNA against CDC20 was subsequently assessed in a xenograft model, which indicated a reduced tumor growth as a result of CDC20 DsiRNA therapy.

Arabidopsis was employed to test if heterologous expression of SUB1A-1 or SUB1C-1 (a related gene) can be used to improve saccharification. Cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymatic treatments confirmed that SUB1A-1 transgenics had better saccharification yield than wild-type (Col-0), mainly from accumulated starch.

We measured photosynthetic parameters, starch granule microstructure, and transcript abundance of genes involved in starch degradation (SEX4, GWD1), juvenile transition (SPL3-5) and meristematic identity (FUL, SOC1) but found no differences to Col-0, indicating that starch accumulation may be controlled by down-regulation of CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T by SUB1A-1 as previously reported.

We show here that Spt21, together with its partner protein Spt10, regulates histone gene transcription by enabling the recruitment of a roster of chromatin-remodeling proteins.", "contributors": [{"name": "Kurat, Christoph F.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Kurat", "additionalName": "F.", "givenName": "Christoph", "email": ""}, {"name": "Lambert, Jean-Philippe", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lambert", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jean-Philippe", "email": ""}, {"name": "Petschnigg, Julia", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Petschnigg", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Julia", "email": ""}, {"name": "Friesen, Helena", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Friesen", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Helena", "email": ""}, {"name": "Pawson, Tony", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Pawson", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Tony", "email": ""}, {"name": "Rosebrock, Adam", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Rosebrock", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Adam", "email": ""}, {"name": "Gingras, Anne-Claude", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Gingras", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Anne-Claude", "email": ""}, {"name": "Fillingham, Jeffrey", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Fillingham", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jeffrey", "email": ""}, {"name": "Andrews, Brenda", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Andrews", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Brenda", "email": ""}], "title": "Cell cycle-regulated oscillator coordinates core histone gene transcription through histone acetylation", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biological sciences"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-30T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191790"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Having a precise knowledge of the dispersal ability of a population in a\nheterogeneous environment is of critical importance in agroecology and\nconservation biology as it can provide management tools to limit the effects of\npests or to increase the survival of endangered species.

To use insects in estimating PMI, we must be able to determine the insect age at the time of discovery and backtrack to time of oviposition. Unfortunately, existing development models of forensically important insects are only linear approximations and do not take into account the curvilinear properties experienced at extreme temperatures. A series of experiments were conducted with Lucilia sericata, a forensically important blow fly species, that met the requirements needed to create statistically valid development models. Experiments were conducted over 11 temperatures (7.5 to 32.5 \u00b0C, at 2.5 \u00b0C) with a 16:8 L:D cycle. Experimental units contained 20 eggs, 10 g beef liver, and 2.5 cm of pine shavings. Each life stage (egg to adult) had five sampling times. Each sampling time was replicated four times, for a total of 20 measurements per life stage. For each sampling time, the cups were pulled from the chambers and the stage of each maggot was documented morphologically through posterior spiracle slits and cephalopharyngeal skeletal development. Data were normally distributed with the later larval stages (L3f, L3m) having the most variation within and transitioning between stages. The biological minimum was between 7.5 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C, with little egg development and no egg emergence at 7.5 \u00b0C. Temperature-induced mortality was highest from 10.0 to 17.5 \u00b0C and 32.5 \u00b0C.

We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data\nfrom the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the\nepidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive\nset of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for\naccurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the\nworld. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model\ndifferentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different\nprovinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the\noutbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction\nnumber is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction\nnumber are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.\n", "Comment: published on Journal of Theoretical biology"]}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["quantitative biology - other quantitative biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-17T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1684"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "The Royal Society"}, "description": "The robust jaws and large, thick-enameled molars of the Plio\u2013Pleistocene hominins Australopithecus and Paranthropus have long been interpreted as adaptations for hard-object feeding.

Glioma stem cells (GSCs), a small population of tumor cells with stem-like properties, are supposedly responsible for glioblastoma multiforme relapse after current therapies. In approximately thirty percent of glioblastoma multiforme tumors, telomeres are not maintained by telomerase but through an alternative mechanism, termed alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT), suggesting potential interest in developing specific therapeutic strategies. However, no preclinical model of ALT glioma was available until the isolation of TG20 cells from a human ALT glioma. Herein, we show that TG20 cells exhibit a high level of telomeric recombination but a stable karyotype, indicating that their telomeres retain their protective function against chromosomal instability. TG20 cells possess all of the characteristic features of GSCs: the expression of neural stem cell markers, the generation of intracerebral tumors in NOD-SCID-IL2R\u03b3 (NSG) mice as well as in nude mice, and the ability to sustain serial intracerebral transplantations without expressing telomerase, demonstrating the stability of the ALT phenotype in vivo. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that 360B, a G-quadruplex ligand of the pyridine derivative series that impairs telomere replication and mitotic progression in cancer cells, prevents the development of TG20 tumors. Together, our results show that intracerebral grafts of TG20 cells in immunodeficient mice constitute an efficient preclinical model of ALT glioblastoma multiforme and that G-quadruplex ligands are a potential therapy for this specific type of tumor.", "contributors": [{"name": "Jeitany, Maya", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Jeitany", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Maya", "email": ""}, {"name": "Pineda, Jose Ramon", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Pineda", "additionalName": "Ramon", "givenName": "Jose", "email": ""}, {"name": "Liu, Qingyuan", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Liu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Qingyuan", "email": ""}, {"name": "Porreca, Rosa Maria", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Porreca", "additionalName": "Maria", "givenName": "Rosa", "email": ""}, {"name": "Hoffschir, Fran\u00e7oise", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hoffschir", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Fran\u00e7oise", "email": ""}, {"name": "Desmaze, Chantal", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Desmaze", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Chantal", "email": ""}, {"name": "Silvestre, David C", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Silvestre", "additionalName": "C", "givenName": "David", "email": ""}, {"name": "Mailliet, Patrick", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Mailliet", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Patrick", "email": ""}, {"name": "Junier, Marie-Pierre", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Junier", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Marie-Pierre", "email": ""}, {"name": "Londo\u00f1o-Vallejo, Arturo", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Londo\u00f1o-Vallejo", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Arturo", "email": ""}, {"name": "S\u00e9gal-Bendirdjian, Evelyne", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "S\u00e9gal-Bendirdjian", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Evelyne", "email": ""}, {"name": "Chneiweiss, Herv\u00e9", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Chneiweiss", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Herv\u00e9", "email": ""}, {"name": "Boussin, Fran\u00e7ois D", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Boussin", "additionalName": "D", "givenName": "Fran\u00e7ois", "email": ""}], "title": "A preclinical mouse model of glioma with an alternative mechanism of telomere maintenance (ALT)", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer cell biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-02T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4303977"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "The technique of in vitro selection was used to learn more about the properties of RNA sequence space.

This thesis overviews the design of a molecular sensor to measure cellular forces and a hydrogel system to engineer angiogenic sprouting. We developed molecular force probes (FPs) that report traction forces of adherent cells with high spatial resolution, can be linked to virtually any surface, and do not require monitoring deformations of elastic substrates. FPs consist of DNA hairpins conjugated to fluorophore-quencher pairs that unfold and fluoresce when subjected to specific amounts of force. In chapter two we overview the synthetic strategies to produce these FPs from solid-state synthesis. We then demonstrate the chemical and physical characterization of these FPs. These data show that the FPs can be designed rationally from existing knowledge of the force-responsiveness of DNA hairpins. Chapter three summarizes our methods to affix these FPs to solid substrates to measure cellular traction forces. The silane chemistry to conjugate these FPs to glass coverslips is reported in detail. Then, the results of converting the fluorescence of these FPs to force values is given along with biological validation. We find using this method that cellular tractions are exerted at the distal ends of focal adhesions. In chapter four we present a versatile bioactive PEG hydrogel to study angiogenesis. This material is MMP-degradable and cell-adhesive.

Because NO is a potent collateral vessel dilator, this study examined whether NO derived from iNOS or constitutive NOS regulates myocardial blood flow (MBF) in the collateral region. Nonselective NOS inhibition with NG-nitro-l-arginine (LNA) caused vasoconstriction with a significant decrease in MBF to the collateral region during exercise.

Although fate maps are very useful for identifying the precursors of an organ and for elucidating the developmental path by which the descendant cells populate that organ in the normal embryo, they do not illustrate the full developmental potential of a precursor cell or identify the mechanisms by which its fate is determined. To test for cell fate commitment, one compares a cell's normal repertoire of descendants in the intact embryo (the fate map) with those expressed after an experimental manipulation. Is the cell's fate fixed (committed) regardless of the surrounding cellular environment, or is it influenced by external factors provided by its neighbors? Using the comprehensive fate maps of the Xenopus embryo, we describe how to identify, isolate and culture single cleavage stage precursors, called blastomeres. This approach allows one to assess whether these early cells are committed to the fate they acquire in their normal environment in the intact embryo, require interactions with their neighboring cells, or can be influenced to express alternate fates if exposed to other types of signals.", "contributors": [{"name": "Grant, Paaqua A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Grant", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Paaqua", "email": ""}, {"name": "Herold, Mona B.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Herold", "additionalName": "B.", "givenName": "Mona", "email": ""}, {"name": "Moody, Sally A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Moody", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Sally", "email": ""}], "title": "Blastomere Explants to Test for Cell Fate Commitment During Embryonic Development", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["developmental biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-26T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3582656"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  We are interested in a variation of the SIR (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered)\ndynamics on the complete graph, in which infected individuals may only spread\nto neighboring susceptible individuals at fixed rate $\\lambda>0$ while\nrecovered individuals may only spread to neighboring infected individuals at\nfixed rate $1$.

Understanding how stem cells are maintained in vivo is crucial for their clinical application. Studies on various stem cell systems have demonstrated that the stem cell niche, or local tissue microenvironment, provides important extracellular cues to guide stem cell behaviors. The Drosophila male germline system has emerged as an exemplary model for studying stem cell-niche biology. The apically located hub cells function as a shared niche for two stem cell populations: germline stem cells (GSCs) and cyst stem cells (CySCs). A dominant model in the field describes hub cells as the single niche for GSCs via promoting JAK-STAT signaling. However, recent work from our lab has demonstrated that BMP signaling is the primary pathway leading to GSC self-renewal. We have also revealed that CySCs function as a second niche to govern GSC maintenance. In this thesis, we identify Magu as a novel regulator controlling GSC self-renewal. We show that Magu is expressed from hub cells, and specifically required for GSC maintenance. We also show that Magu acts as an extracellular BMP modulator through interaction with Dally-like, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Our characterization of Magu further emphasizes the importance of BMP signaling in male GSC maintenance.\nZfh1 is a transcription factor expressed in CySCs. Zfh1 is required for CySC maintenance, and can also induce ectopic GSCs non-autonomously. Thus, Zfh1 exerts an impact on two stem cell lineages, matching with our recent notion that CySCs function as both a stem cell and a niche for GSCs. To dissect out how Zfh1 controls stem cell self-renewal, we attempt to identify target genes of Zfh1 using two genome-wide approaches: ChIP-Seq and a genetic modifier screen. Preliminary results show that eya and shg may be direct targets of Zfh1, and CtBP is required for Zfh1 function. This ongoing project will further elucidate the dual role of CySCs, and advance our understanding of the complex niche signals regulating stem cells.", "contributors": [{"name": "Zheng, Qi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zheng", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Qi", "email": ""}], "title": "Novel Regulators In The Germline Stem Cell Niche Of Drosophila Testis", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1674", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2798&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2798"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": "publication:edissertations"}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["stem cell niche", "biology", "stem cell", "drosophila testis"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T19:06:58", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1674"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Microfluidic biosensors have been utilized for sensing a wide range of\nantigens using numerous configurations.

This morphological study in monkey eyes investigates the composition and distribution of several connective tissue components in the accommodative apparatus relaying muscle force to lens organization. Elastin distributes on the marginal surface of the ciliary process. A zonule is composed of fibrillin produced by epithelial cells of the process. In the progress of extension over the posterior chamber, fibrils unite into strands and possess longitudinal plasticity. By induction of the elastin network, strands extend in a concentric direction covering the equatorial region of the capsule. Upon tethering to the lens, the strand ramifies into fibrils, penetrating deeply close to the epithelial layer of the lens and binding with the collagen of the intercellular spaces. Tight linkage of the zonule with the capsule transmits precise contractility. Inside the lens, the cortical layer's elastic connective tissue network forms widely spaced lamellae of crystalline fibers. In contrast, the central nuclear lamellae are tightly opposed. The accumulation of lamellae is greater in the anterior cortex than in the posterior, yielding a more variable anterior chamber depth in the visual axis. The plasticity of the zonule and connective tissue distribution inside the lens produces an adjustable configuration. Thus, tight linkage between the dynamism of the capsule with interaction of the lenticular flexibility provides a novel understanding of accommodation.

These studies examined the signal transduction pathways operant in FGF-19-mediated repression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). Responses to FGF-19 were assessed in Caco-2 and CT-26 cells and in mice where c-fos was conditionally silenced in the intestine by a cre-lox strategy. FGF-19 treatment of Caco-2 cells or wild-type mice led to a significant reduction in ASBT protein expression and enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signaling kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Fos, and c-Jun. FGF-19 treatment of Caco-2 cells led to a reduction in activity of the human ASBT promoter and this repression could be blocked by treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor or by silencing jun kinase 1, jun kinase 2, c-fos, or c-jun. Site directed mutagenesis of a c-fos binding element in the ASBT promoter blocked FGF-19-mediated repression in luciferase reporter constructs. ASBT promoter activity was repressed by FGF-19 in CT-26 cells and this repression could be reduced by MEK1/2 inhibition or silencing c-fos.

In this thesis we have focused on the roles of two downstream transcriptional effectors, Eyes absent (EYA) and Spenito (NITO), in Drosophila eye development.", "(cont.) EYA is a member of the retinal determination gene network (RDGN), a network of transcription factors and cofactors that when mutated result in defects in eye development, and when overexpressed can induce ectopic eye development. EYA functions as a part of a bipartite transcriptional complex, with EYA providing the transactivation function for the complex, and its cofactor Sine oculis (SO), providing the DNA-binding function. In addition to acting as a transcription cofactor, EYA also functions as a protein phosphatase, presenting a unique juxtaposition of functions and raising the question, how are these functions related? In order to examine how transcriptional activity is affected by mutating EYA phosphatase activity, we needed to identify additional transcriptional targets, given that only one target had been identified at the time these experiments began. Using microarray analysis, we compared expression profiles of wildtype tissue to those of tissue overexpressing a wildtype eya transgene. In parallel, we overexpressed a phosphatase mutant eya transgene, which allowed us to examine the overall effects of reducing phosphatase activity on transcriptional output.", "(cont.) We identified 577 genes with altered expression upon overexpression of wildtype or mutant eya and confirmed 6 genes as direct targets of EYA transcriptional regulation, including string, a cell cycle regulatory gene. Stg is a particularly intriguing target, given previously characterized proliferation defects observed in tissue misexpressing eya and so. In addition, our array results suggest that mutating EYA phosphatase activity does not globally impair EYA's transcriptional output, suggesting that these functions are somewhat independent. Further analysis of transcriptional target expression and identification of targets of EYA phosphatase activity will be necessary to understand how these two functions are integrated during development. In addition, we have examined the role of SPOC family proteins, which function as effectors of Notch, Wingless and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling, in Drosophila eye development. Studies of these proteins in cultured cells have demonstrated their ability to function as transcriptional coregulators. In the work presented here, we have investigated the role of the small SPOC protein, Spenito (NITO), during Drosophila eye development and analyzed its relationship to a large SPOC protein, Split ends (SPEN), which is predicted to have redundant function.", "(cont.) First, we characterized the eye phenotypes arising from overexpression of nito. Overexpression of nito perturbs eye development and in contrast to spen, which has been shown to act as a positive effector of EGFR signaling, appears to be a negative effector of EGFR signaling during eye development. Further genetic analysis of the relationship between spen and nito in the eye suggests they function antagonistically, possibly by targeting a common set of genes for transcriptional regulation. Further analysis of SPOC family mutants and study of the functions of these proteins at a molecular level will be necessary to understand the relationship of small and large SPOC proteins and the roles of the proteins in development and disease.", "by Jennifer Colleen Jemc.", "Thesis (Ph.

Due to their optical clarity and amenability to genetic manipulation, the zebrafish embryo has become a popular model organism with which to perform time-lapse analysis of morphogenesis in living embryos. Confocal imaging of a live zebrafish embryo requires that a tissue of interest is persistently labeled with a fluorescent marker, such as a transgene or injected dye. The process demands that the embryo is anesthetized and held in place in such a way that healthy development proceeds normally. Parameters for imaging must be set to account for three-dimensional growth and to balance the demands of resolving individual cells while getting quick snapshots of development. Our results demonstrate the ability to perform long-term in vivo imaging of fluorescence-labeled zebrafish embryos and to detect varied tissue behaviors in the cranial neural crest that cause craniofacial abnormalities. Developmental delays caused by anesthesia and mounting are minimal, and embryos are unharmed by the process. Time-lapse imaged embryos can be returned to liquid medium and subsequently imaged or fixed at later points in development. With an increasing abundance of transgenic zebrafish lines and well-characterized fate mapping and transplantation techniques, imaging any desired tissue is possible.

In yeast these complex particles contain four RNAs (>5400 nucleotides) and 79 different proteins. During the past 25 years, studies in yeast have led the way to understanding how these molecules are assembled into ribosomes in vivo. Assembly begins with transcription of ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus, where the RNA then undergoes complex pathways of folding, coupled with nucleotide modification, removal of spacer sequences, and binding to ribosomal proteins. More than 200 assembly factors and 76 small nucleolar RNAs transiently associate with assembling ribosomes, to enable their accurate and efficient construction.

A primer combination was synthesized by reference to homologs of lsadh, and PCR was used to amplify nearly full-length adh genes from metagenomic DNAs. All adh preparations were fused with lsadh at the terminal region and used to construct Escherichia coli plasmid libraries. Of the approximately 2,000 colonies obtained, 1,200 clones were identified as adh positive (\u223c60%).

The Hladh genes obtained via this approach encoded a wide variety of amino acid sequences (8 to 99%).

The key locations of these adhesions, close to the diaphragm, prevent the weight of the abdominal contents from acting on the lungs when the sloth is inverted. Using ventilation rate and body orientation data collected from captive and wild sloths, we use an energetics-based model to estimate that these small adhesions could reduce the energy expenditure of a sloth at any time it is fully inverted by almost 13%. Given body angle preferences for individual sloths in our study over time, this equates to mean energy saving of 0.8\u20131.5% across individuals (with individual values ranging between 0.01 and 8.6%) per day.

It has been proposed that intracellular reduction of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] to trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] may cause bacterial death by a mechanism that involves reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA damage; the molecular basis of the phenomenon was investigated in this work. Here, we report that Bacillus subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention oxidized guanine (GO) system were significantly more sensitive to Cr(VI) treatment than cells of the wild-type (WT) strain, suggesting that oxidative damage to DNA is involved in the deleterious effects of the oxyanion. In agreement with this suggestion, Cr(VI) dramatically increased the ROS concentration and induced mutagenesis in a GO-deficient B. subtilis strain. Alkaline gel electrophoresis (AGE) analysis of chromosomal DNA of WT and \u0394GO mutant strains subjected to Cr(VI) treatment revealed that the DNA of the \u0394GO strain was more susceptible to DNA glycosylase Fpg attack, suggesting that chromium genotoxicity is associated with 7,8-dihydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-G) lesions. In support of this notion, specific monoclonal antibodies detected the accumulation of 8-oxo-G lesions in the chromosomes of B. subtilis cells subjected to Cr(VI) treatment.

The translucent cuticle of the Drosophila larva makes it an attractive model organism for live imaging studies. However, an important challenge for live imaging techniques is to noninvasively immobilize and position an animal on the microscope. This protocol presents a simple and easy to use method for immobilizing and imaging Drosophila larvae on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device, which we call the 'larva chip'. The larva chip is comprised of a snug-fitting PDMS microchamber that is attached to a thin glass coverslip, which, upon application of a vacuum via a syringe, immobilizes the animal and brings ventral structures such as the nerve cord, segmental nerves, and body wall muscles, within close proximity to the coverslip. This allows for high-resolution imaging, and importantly, avoids the use of anesthetics and chemicals, which facilitates the study of a broad range of physiological processes. Since larvae recover easily from the immobilization, they can be readily subjected to multiple imaging sessions. This allows for longitudinal studies over time courses ranging from hours to days. This protocol describes step-by-step how to prepare the chip and how to utilize the chip for live imaging of neuronal events in 3rd instar larvae. These events include the rapid transport of organelles in axons, calcium responses to injury, and time-lapse studies of the trafficking of photo-convertible proteins over long distances and time scales. Another application of the chip is to study regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal injury, so the second part of this protocol describes a new and simple procedure for injuring axons within peripheral nerves by a segmental nerve crush.", "contributors": [{"name": "Mishra, Bibhudatta", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Mishra", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Bibhudatta", "email": ""}, {"name": "Ghannad-Rezaie, Mostafa", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ghannad-Rezaie", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Mostafa", "email": ""}, {"name": "Li, Jiaxing", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Li", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jiaxing", "email": ""}, {"name": "Wang, Xin", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Xin", "email": ""}, {"name": "Hao, Yan", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hao", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Yan", "email": ""}, {"name": "Ye, Bing", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ye", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Bing", "email": ""}, {"name": "Chronis, Nikos", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Chronis", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Nikos", "email": ""}, {"name": "Collins, Catherine A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Collins", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Catherine", "email": ""}], "title": "Using Microfluidics Chips for Live Imaging and Study of Injury Responses in Drosophila Larvae", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["bioengineering"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-02-07T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4117361"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "Creating a physiologically relevant in vitro liver model requires reproducing the cellular heterogeneity of in vivo liver in a functional state.

Retention of SE-i staining cells even in higher flow rates demonstrated that hypoxic conditions in the tissue could play a role in aiding their survival by overcoming negative effects brought about by high flow. The relationship of stellate cells with flow rate was unaffected by oxygen concentrations. To explore if the negative effects of high flow on SE-i expression were mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-[beta]), we added a TGF-[beta] inhibitor SB-431542 in our cultures, and found that it greatly enhanced the presence of SE-1 staining SECs at high flow rates. In conclusion we successfully created a three-dimensional flow controlled hepatic culture system that allows balanced survival of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, making it useful as a potential model for studies such as cancer metastasis that require interactions between tumor cells and heterotypic host tissue.

To dissect the regulatory network of cardiac Ca2+ handling, we performed a chemical suppressor screen on zebrafish tremblor embryos, which suffer from Ca2+ extrusion defects. Efsevin was identified based on its potent activity to restore coordinated contractions in tremblor. We show that efsevin binds to VDAC2, potentiates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and accelerates the transfer of Ca2+ from intracellular stores into mitochondria. In cardiomyocytes, efsevin restricts the temporal and spatial boundaries of Ca2+ sparks and thereby inhibits Ca2+ overload-induced erratic Ca2+ waves and irregular contractions. We further show that overexpression of VDAC2 recapitulates the suppressive effect of efsevin on tremblor embryos whereas VDAC2 deficiency attenuates efsevin's rescue effect and that VDAC2 functions synergistically with MCU to suppress cardiac fibrillation in tremblor. Together, these findings demonstrate a critical modulatory role for VDAC2-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the regulation of cardiac rhythmicity.", "contributors": [{"name": "Shimizu, Hirohito", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Shimizu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Hirohito", "email": ""}, {"name": "Schredelseker, Johann", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Schredelseker", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Johann", "email": ""}, {"name": "Huang, Jie", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Huang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jie", "email": ""}, {"name": "Lu, Kui", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Kui", "email": ""}, {"name": "Naghdi, Shamim", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Naghdi", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Shamim", "email": ""}, {"name": "Lu, Fei", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Fei", "email": ""}, {"name": "Franklin, Sarah", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Franklin", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Sarah", "email": ""}, {"name": "Fiji, Hannah DG", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Fiji", "additionalName": "DG", "givenName": "Hannah", "email": ""}, {"name": "Wang, Kevin", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Kevin", "email": ""}, {"name": "Zhu, Huanqi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zhu", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Huanqi", "email": ""}, {"name": "Tian, Cheng", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Tian", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Cheng", "email": ""}, {"name": "Lin, Billy", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Lin", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Billy", "email": ""}, {"name": "Nakano, Haruko", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Nakano", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Haruko", "email": ""}, {"name": "Ehrlich, Amy", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ehrlich", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Amy", "email": ""}, {"name": "Nakai, Junichi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Nakai", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Junichi", "email": ""}, {"name": "Stieg, Adam Z", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Stieg", "additionalName": "Z", "givenName": "Adam", "email": ""}, {"name": "Gimzewski, James K", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Gimzewski", "additionalName": "K", "givenName": "James", "email": ""}, {"name": "Nakano, Atsushi", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Nakano", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Atsushi", "email": ""}, {"name": "Goldhaber, Joshua I", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Goldhaber", "additionalName": "I", "givenName": "Joshua", "email": ""}, {"name": "Vondriska, Thomas M", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Vondriska", "additionalName": "M", "givenName": "Thomas", "email": ""}, {"name": "Hajn\u00f3czky, Gy\u00f6rgy", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hajn\u00f3czky", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Gy\u00f6rgy", "email": ""}, {"name": "Kwon, Ohyun", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Kwon", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Ohyun", "email": ""}, {"name": "Chen, Jau-Nian", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Chen", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jau-Nian", "email": ""}], "title": "Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by the voltage-dependent anion channel 2 regulates cardiac rhythmicity", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cell biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-30T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293673"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  The behavior of long DNA molecules in a cell-sized confined space was\ninvestigated.

Dynamic compression and dynamic shear increased matrix protein transcription particularly after 24 hours. In contrast, matrix proteases were upregulated by all 24 hour loading regimes, particularly static compression. Taken together these results demonstrate the functionally-coordinated regulation of chondrocyte gene transcription in response to mechanical forces, and support the hypothesis that dynamic loading is anabolic for cartilage and static loading is anti-anabolic. Intracellular calcium release, cAMP activation of protein-kinase-A, and the phosphorylation of MAP kinases (ERK1/2, p38), were all identified as signaling events necessary for mechanically-induced transcription. In addition, we measured the immediate, transient increase in mRNA levels of transcription factors downstream of the MAP kinase pathway (c-Fos and c-Jun), in response to all three loading types. The prevention of protein synthesis during static compression suppressed mechanically-induced transcription suggesting that signaling molecules are synthesized in response to mechanical forces.

Filaggrin-silenced cells (LV group), shRNA control cells (NC\ngroup), and noninfected cells (Blank group) were evaluated. The expression of\ncornified cell envelope-related proteins, including cytokeratin (CK)-5, -10, -14,\nloricrin, involucrin, and transglutaminase (TGM)-1, was detected by Western blotting.\nInterleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12p70, IL-13, and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) were\ndetected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The KalTA4-ERT2/UAS system is both inducible and reversible which allows us to induce cell transformation with precise temporal/spatial resolution in vivo. This provides us with a unique opportunity to live image how individual preneoplastic cells interact with host tissues as soon as they emerge, then follow their progression as well as regression. Recent studies in zebrafish larvae have shown a trophic function of innate immunity in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis2,3. Our inducible system would allow us to live image the onset of cellular transformation and the subsequent host response, which may lead to important insights on the underlying mechanisms for the regulation of oncogenic trophic inflammatory responses.

As the virus adapts, the information the virus encodes\nabout its environment must change, and this change is reflected in the\namino-acid composition of proteins, as well as changes in viral RNAs, binding\nsites, and splice sites. Information can also be encoded in the interaction\nbetween residues in a single protein as well as across proteins, leading to a\nchange in the epistatic patterns that can affect how the virus can change in\nthe future. Measuring epistasis usually requires fitness measurements that are\ndifficult to obtain in high-throughput. Here we show that epistasis can be\ninferred from the pair-wise information between residues, and study how\nepistasis and information have changed over the long-term.

As the virus adapts, the information the virus encodes\nabout its environment must change, and this change is reflected in the\namino-acid composition of proteins, as well as changes in viral RNAs, binding\nsites, and splice sites. Information can also be encoded in the interaction\nbetween residues in a single protein as well as across proteins, leading to a\nchange in the epistatic patterns that can affect how the virus can change in\nthe future.

LR asymmetry emerges early in development, and in many species the primary determinant of this asymmetry has been linked to the cytoskeleton. However, the nature of the underlying chirally asymmetric cytoskeletal processes has remained elusive. In this study, we combine thin-film active chiral fluid theory with experimental analysis of the C. elegans embryo to show that the actomyosin cortex generates active chiral torques to facilitate chiral symmetry breaking. Active torques drive chiral counter-rotating cortical flow in the zygote, depend on myosin activity, and can be altered through mild changes in Rho signaling.

Here we analyzed the patterns of genetic diversity in coexisting populations of three genera of bacteria (Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, and Pseudomonas) that are abundant in the aquatic systems of the Cuatro Cienegas Basin, Mexico. We tested the hypothesis that a common habitat leaves a signature upon the genetic variation present in bacterial populations, independent of phylogenetic relationships. We used multilocus markers to assess genetic diversity and (1) performed comparative phylogenetic analyses, (2) described the genetic structure of bacterial populations, (3) calculated descriptive parameters of genetic diversity, (4) performed neutrality tests, and (5) conducted coalescent-based historical reconstructions.

Pre- and coadministration of paeoniflorin significantly reduced the severity of colitis and resulted in downregulation of several inflammatory parameters in the colon, including the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and the mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators (MCP-1, Cox2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-17). The decline in the activation of NF-\u03baB p65, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK correlated with a decrease in mucosal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but not TLR2 or TLR5 expression. In accordance with the in vivo results, paeoniflorin downregulated TLR4 expression, blocked nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65, and reduced the production of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Transient transfection assay performed in LPS-stimulated human colon cancer HT-29 cells indicated that paeoniflorin inhibits NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. TLR4 knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrated a requirement for TLR4 in paeoniflorin-mediated downregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, for the first time, the present study indicates that paeoniflorin abrogates DSS-induced colitis via decreasing the expression of TLR4 and suppressing the activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways.", "contributors": [{"name": "Zhang, Jingjing", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zhang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Jingjing", "email": ""}, {"name": "Dou, Wei", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Dou", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Wei", "email": ""}, {"name": "Zhang, Eryun", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zhang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Eryun", "email": ""}, {"name": "Sun, Aning", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Sun", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Aning", "email": ""}, {"name": "Ding, Lili", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Ding", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Lili", "email": ""}, {"name": "Wei, Xiaohui", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wei", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Xiaohui", "email": ""}, {"name": "Chou, Guixin", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Chou", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Guixin", "email": ""}, {"name": "Mani, Sridhar", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Mani", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Sridhar", "email": ""}, {"name": "Wang, Zhengtao", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Zhengtao", "email": ""}], "title": "Paeoniflorin abrogates DSS-induced colitis via a TLR4-dependent pathway", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["mucosal biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3920084"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "description": "Molecular markers for adult stem cells (ASCs) are highly demanded for research and clinical applications.

The SRPA gene signature clustered and classified putative epidermal stem cell-enriched populations better than reported stemness gene signatures in PCA. Therefore, gene microarray analyses for studying self-renewal pattern per se confirmed for the first time that asymmetric self-renewal is an essential molecular feature of ASCs in vivo. Chromosome mapping of the SRPA genes identified two SRPA chromosome gene cluster regions. One chromosome cluster contained primarily ASRA genes, whereas the other contained primarily symmetric self-renewal associated (SSRA) genes. These two SRPA chromosome cluster regions are frequently rearranged or deleted in particular human cancers. Functional and expression analysis of several selected ASRA and SSRA gene-encoded proteins implicated them in control of asymmetric self-renewal and non-random chromosome co-segregation, respectively. Moreover, one plasma membrane bound ASRA protein, CXCR6, had properties of one of the most specific molecular markers for ASCs described to date. In conclusion, this research strongly supported the precept that asymmetric self-renewal is a unique molecular feature for understanding ASCs, their relation to cancer, their unique function, and for their eventual exclusive identification.", "by Minsoo Noh.", "Thesis (Ph.

In order to understand how the graphene coating could change biological response, cell viability of rat aortic endothelial cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. Moreover, the effect of graphene-coatings on cell adhesion and morphology was examined with fluorescent confocal microscopy. Cells were stained for actin and nuclei, and there were noticeable differences between pristine nitinol samples compared to graphene-coated samples. Total actin expression from rat aortic smooth muscle cells was found using western blot. Protein adsorption characteristics, an indicator for potential thrombogenicity, were determined for serum albumin and fibrinogen with gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the transfer of charge from fibrinogen to substrate was deduced using Raman spectroscopy. It was found that graphene coating on nitinol substrates met the functional requirements for a stent material and improved the biological response compared to uncoated nitinol.

The adjacent accessory helix (AH) is not conserved despite also playing an important role in CPX function, and numerous models for its mechanism have been proposed. We examined the impact of AH mutations and chimeras on CPX function in vivo and in vitro using C. elegans. The mouse AH fully restored function when substituted into worm CPX suggesting its mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. CPX inhibitory function was impaired when helix propagation into the CH was disrupted whereas replacing the AH with a non-native helical sequence restored CPX function.

The relative binding affinities for some marine mammal AHRs fall between those for the high-affinity mouse AHRb-1 and the lower affinity human AHR.

The reproductive ecology of pioneer species at deep-sea hydrothermal vents may provide insight into their dispersal, population connectivity, and ability to colonize after disturbance. An opportunity to study the reproductive traits of two pioneer gastropod species, Ctenopelta porfera and Lepetodrilus tevnianus, presented itself in 2006 after an eruption on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) eliminated vent communities near 9\u00b050'N. Standard histological techniques were used to determine whether reproductive characteristics, such as timing of gamete release, fecundity, or time to maturation, differed from other vent gastropods in ways that might explain arrival of these two species as early colonizers. Both species exhibited two-component oocyte size frequency distributions that indicated they were quasi-continuous reproducers with high fecundity. In C. porifera, the oocyte size distributions differed slightly between two collection dates, suggesting that environmental cues may introduce some variability in gamete release. In samples collected within one year of the estimated eruption date, individuals in populations of both C. porfera and L. tevnianus were reproductively mature.

The reproductive ecology of pioneer species at deep-sea hydrothermal vents may provide insight into their dispersal, population connectivity, and ability to colonize after disturbance. An opportunity to study the reproductive traits of two pioneer gastropod species, Ctenopelta porfera and Lepetodrilus tevnianus, presented itself in 2006 after an eruption on the East Pacific Rise (EPR) eliminated vent communities near 9\u00b050'N. Standard histological techniques were used to determine whether reproductive characteristics, such as timing of gamete release, fecundity, or time to maturation, differed from other vent gastropods in ways that might explain arrival of these two species as early colonizers. Both species exhibited two-component oocyte size frequency distributions that indicated they were quasi-continuous reproducers with high fecundity. In C. porifera, the oocyte size distributions differed slightly between two collection dates, suggesting that environmental cues may introduce some variability in gamete release. In samples collected within one year of the estimated eruption date, individuals in populations of both C. porfera and L. tevnianus were reproductively mature. The smallest reproducing C. porifera were 4.2 mm (males) and 5.4 mm (females) in shell length, whereas reproductive L. tevnianus were smaller (2.3 and 2.4 mm in males and females respectively).

Despite growing consensus that anthropogenic climate change will increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of extreme events, current understanding of their impact on communities and ecosystems is limited. Here, we used sessile invertebrates on settlement panels as model assemblages to examine the influence of HW magnitude, duration and timing on marine biodiversity patterns. Settlement panels were deployed in a marina in southwest UK for \u22655 weeks, to allow sufficient time for colonisation and development of sessile fauna, before being subjected to simulated HWs in a mesocosm facility. Replicate panel assemblages were held at ambient sea temperature (\u223c17 \u00b0C), or +3 \u00b0C or +5 \u00b0C for a period of 1 or 2 weeks, before being returned to the marina for a recovery phase of 2\u20133 weeks. The 10-week experiment was repeated 3 times, staggered throughout summer, to examine the influence of HW timing on community impacts. Contrary to our expectations, the warming events had no clear, consistent impacts on the abundance of species or the structure of sessile assemblages. With the exception of 1 high-magnitude long-duration HW event, warming did not alter not assemblage structure, favour non-native species, nor lead to changes in richness, abundance or biomass of sessile faunal assemblages. The observed lack of effect may have been caused by a combination of (1) the use of relatively low magnitude, realistic heat wave treatments compared to previous studies (2), the greater resilience of mature adult sessile fauna compared to recruits and juveniles, and (3) the high thermal tolerance of the model organisms (i.e., temperate fouling species, principally bryozoans and ascidians). Our study demonstrates the importance of using realistic treatments when manipulating climate change variables, and also suggests that biogeographical context may influence community-level responses to short-term warming events, which are predicted to increase in severity in the future.", "contributors": [{"name": "Smale, Dan A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Smale", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Dan", "email": ""}, {"name": "Yunnie, Anna L.E.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Yunnie", "additionalName": "L.E.", "givenName": "Anna", "email": ""}, {"name": "Vance, Thomas", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Vance", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Thomas", "email": ""}, {"name": "Widdicombe, Stephen", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Widdicombe", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Stephen", "email": ""}], "title": "Disentangling the impacts of heat wave magnitude, duration and timing on the structure and diversity of sessile marine assemblages", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biodiversity"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4380158"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "Since the discovery of Orsay, the first virus that naturally infects nematodes, it has been widely expected that Caenorhabditis elegans-Orsay would serve as a highly tractable model for studying viral pathogenesis.

Of the sixteen constructs, large-scale expression/purification of two LacY/cytochromeb562 constructs was successful but crystallization proved difficult.

This structure has almost occluded, outward-open conformation with a rotation at the thioester linkage in TDG as compared to the previous structures. We obtained crystals of this double-mutant with octyl B-D-galactopyranoside that diffracted to ~20 \u00c5. A mutagenesis strategy is proposed to obtain LacY in fully outward-open conformation.

Rescue was associated with reduced telomere-dysfunction induced foci (TIFs) and anaphase bridges, indicating improved telomere capping, which correlates with upregulation of Trf2 and Pot1a, encoding capping proteins in the shelterin complex. Similar gene expression changes, and rescue by Wnt pathway activation, were observed in human cells suffering from telomere dysfunction, including those derived from dyskeratosis congenita and Werner syndrome patients.

It is well established that in most animals, the centrioles are contributed to the zygote by the sperm. However, in humans and many animals, the sperm centrioles are modified in their structure and protein composition, or they appear to be missing altogether. In these animals, the origin of the first centrioles is not clear. Here, we review various hypotheses on how centrioles are gained during reproduction and describe specialized functions of the zygotic centrioles. In particular, we discuss a new and atypical centriole found in sperm and zygote, called the proximal centriole-like structure (PCL). We also discuss another type of atypical centriole, the \u201czombie\u201d centriole, which is degenerated but functional. Together, the presence of centrioles, PCL, and zombie centrioles suggests a universal mechanism of centriole inheritance among animals and new causes of infertility.

We examined the molecular basis for phosphorylation-dependent recognition by the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA1 through oriented-peptide-library screening and determination of an X-ray crystal structure of the domain bound to a phosphopeptide. This allowed us to rationalize why inherited mutations within the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA1 promote breast and ovarian cancer in humans. Secondly, we assayed WW domains that were generated from in silicon determined sequences for natural-like function to more fully understand the folding and binding requirements of this domain class.

The study of these mutations yields important insights into the biology of aging. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aging can be studied by mutations that extend the replicative potential of mother cells. With successive cell divisions, instability at the rDNA locus and extrachromosomal rDNA circle accumulation exponentially increase the likelihood of senescence and mortality. Aging can be forestalled by caloric restriction, a regimen that increases the activity of Sir2p, an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase and important regulator of aging in yeast and some metazoans. Caloric restriction activates respiration, reducing cellular NADH levels and relieving the competitive inhibition of Sir2p by this metabolite. SSD1 promotes longevity by a Sir2p-independent mechanism that affects neither ERC formation nor rDNA silencing. Ssd1p directly represses the translation of the mitochondrial and cell wall glycoprotein Uthl.", "(cont.) This repression, which requires a physical interaction between Ssdlp and the 5'-UTR of the UTH1 mRNA, is necessary and sufficient to account for diverse effects of Ssdlp on cell integrity, stress resistance, and life span. Future studies should determine whether Ssd1 plays a role in the maintenance of longevity in higher organisms. Mammalian genomes contain seven Sir2 homologs (SIRT1-7) involved in diverse processes including fat and muscle cell differentiation, p53- and FOXO-dependent apoptosis, stress resistance, and DNA-damage repair. Mouse SIRT6, a nuclear protein, is broadly expressed throughout the body and displays a robust auto-ADP- ribosyltransferase activity unique among Sir2 family members. SIRT7, a nucleolar homolog of Sir2, physically interacts with RNA polymerase I (Pol I), colocalizing with the Pol I complex at the transcribed regions of the rDNA. SIRT7 activates rDNA transcription by an enzymatic mechanism, suggesting a novel model coordinating cellular energy status with ribosome biogenesis via changes in SIRT7 activity.", "by Gregory Liszt.", "Thesis (Ph.

Therefore, reduction of ERC formation infobl cells is likely the consequence of an absence of DSBs caused by replication fork pausing at RFB, again suggesting that DSBs are the initial step in yeast aging. Foblp is also required for transcription enhancement from an ectopic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoter outside of the rDNA, but not at rDNA. The role of Foblp in this enhancement may be to facilitate interactions between rDNA repeats and the ectopic promoter, thus allowing recruitment of Pol I transcriptional machinery to the ectopic promoter. Consistent with this notion, Foblp influences the structural dynamics at rDNA. Foblp antagonizes Sir2p-dependent rDNA silencing and thus affects rDNA chromatin structure. fobl mutation partially suppresses the aberrant rDNA structure in topoisomerase I-deficient (topl) cells, likely by relieving torsional stress created during rDNA replication. In addition, afobl mutation was able to rescue the synthetic lethality in topl trf4 double mutant cells, due to the failure of mitotic condensation at rDNA. fobl mutation complemented several defects caused by trf4 mutation, suggesting that Trf4p, DNA polymerase [sigma], may have a specialized function at rDNA.

This phenotype could be further enhanced by additional loss of p107 and p130. Analysis of mice lacking E2F4, p107, and p130 revealed a requirement for these proteins in regulating fetal hematpoiesis. Taken together, these data suggest that E2F\u00b7pocket protein repressive complexes are critical regulators of differentiation and development.", "by Rebecca L. Landsberg.", "Thesis (Ph.

Despite being one of the first TA systems studied, transcriptional regulation of Escherichia coli mazEF remains poorly understood. This paper presents the solution structure of C-terminal truncated E. coli MazE and a MazE-DNA model with a DNA palindrome sequence \u223c10 bp upstream of the mazEF promoter.

EXP1 encodes a 17 KD Type III integral membrane that cofractionates with ER in wild type cells and with the Golgi in sec21-1 mutants, indicating that Exp1p normally cycles between the Golgi and ER. Bacterially purified Exp1p fusion proteins interact with Sec23/24p in vitro. We have identified specific deletions of the cytosolic domain of EXP1 that fail to complement the lethality of a 1st1Aexp1A double mutant and to bind the Sec23/24p subcomplex. We also demonstrated that these deletion mutants fail to cycle between the Golgi and the ER. Based on these findings, we propose that Exp1p acts to enhance the Sec24p-mediated export of Pma1p from the ER. The identification here of two parallel pathways for Pma1p export from the ER provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms driving the selective uptake of secretory cargo proteins into budding COPII vesicles.", "by Michelle Crotwell Kirtley.", "Thesis (Ph.
