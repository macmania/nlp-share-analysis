Dynamic compression resulted in the significant up-regulation of the three sulfotransferases responsible for the bulk of sulfation in cartilage tissue. These results indicate a transient mechanotransduction reaction that differs based on the load regime. The effect of mechanical loading on the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate has been studied previously, however, this study seeks to examine more comprehensive loading regimes. Static compression and release resulted in an increase in 6-sulfation and a decrease in 4-sulfation that lasted to 48 hours after release of compression. Dynamic compression and release had the opposite effect on sulfation ratio, with an increase in 4-sulfation compared to 6-sulfation. The transcription changes seen in this study do not indicate the changes that occur in the end products of synthesis. Other factors may play a larger role, such as precursor availability or transport through the Golgi apparatus. Intracellular organelles react to static compression of the surrounding tissue in one of two manners. The majority of organelles deform much as the nucleus, proportionally in volume and shape to the cell. The Golgi apparatus appears to retain a significant portion of its volume relative to the cell and other organelles. In addition, it reforms structurally into a highly ordered stacked appearance.", "(cont.) Osmotic forces within the Golgi may allow it to balance the osmotic load in the cytoplasm and resist compression and altered trafficking of the Golgi may in turn produce the altered appearance. Recent microscopy experiments on the Golgi apparatus utilizing two-photon microscopy have allowed us to examine the reaction of live tissue to static compression. These results illustrate the significant, but differing, effects of static and dynamic compression on the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate. The effects of these compression types on the transcription of enzymes responsible for this biosynthesis cannot fully explain the changes seen in newly synthesized chondroitin sulfate. Organelle reorganization has been shown to occur in response to static load and it is possible that altered organelle trafficking plays a role in this altered biosynthesis. Further studies are necessary to determine the final effect of the altered transcription and organelle structure on the manufacture of this important cartilage molecule.", "by Jon D.

Microbial genomes, an increasingly accessible data source, provide an ideal entry point. The genome sequences of different microbes may be compared using the tools of population genetics to infer important genetic changes allowing them to diversify ecologically and adapt to distinct ecological niches. Yet the toolkit of population genetics was developed largely with sexual eukaryotes in mind. In this work, I assess and develop tools for inferring natural selection in microbial genomes. Many tools rely on population genetics theory, and thus require defining distinct populations, or species, of bacteria. Because sex (recombination) is not required for reproduction, some bacteria recombine only rarely, while others are extremely promiscuous, exchanging genes across great genetic distances. This behavior poses a challenge for defining microbial population boundaries. This thesis begins with a discussion of how recombination and positive selection interact to promote ecological adaptation. I then describe a general pipeline for quantifying the impacts of mutation, recombination and selection on microbial genomes, and apply it to two closely related, yet ecologically distinct populations of Vibrio splendidus, each with its own microhabitat preference. I introduce a new tool, STARRInIGHTS, for inferring homologous recombination events. By assessing rates of recombination within and between ecological populations, I conclude that ecological differentiation is driven by small number of habitat-specific alleles, while most loci are shared freely across habitats. The remainder of the thesis focuses on lineage-specific changes in natural selection among anciently diverged species of gamma proteobacteria. I develop two new metrics, selective signatures and slow:fast, for detecting deviations from the expected rate of evolution in 'core' proteins (present in single copy in most species). Because they rely on empirical distributions of evolutionary rates across species, these methods should become increasingly powerful as more and more microbial genomes are sampled.

Microbial genomes, an increasingly accessible data source, provide an ideal entry point. The genome sequences of different microbes may be compared using the tools of population genetics to infer important genetic changes allowing them to diversify ecologically and adapt to distinct ecological niches. Yet the toolkit of population genetics was developed largely with sexual eukaryotes in mind. In this work, I assess and develop tools for inferring natural selection in microbial genomes. Many tools rely on population genetics theory, and thus require defining distinct populations, or species, of bacteria. Because sex (recombination) is not required for reproduction, some bacteria recombine only rarely, while others are extremely promiscuous, exchanging genes across great genetic distances. This behavior poses a challenge for defining microbial population boundaries. This thesis begins with a discussion of how recombination and positive selection interact to promote ecological adaptation. I then describe a general pipeline for quantifying the impacts of mutation, recombination and selection on microbial genomes, and apply it to two closely related, yet ecologically distinct populations of Vibrio splendidus, each with its own microhabitat preference. I introduce a new tool, STARRInIGHTS, for inferring homologous recombination events. By assessing rates of recombination within and between ecological populations, I conclude that ecological differentiation is driven by small number of habitat-specific alleles, while most loci are shared freely across habitats. The remainder of the thesis focuses on lineage-specific changes in natural selection among anciently diverged species of gamma proteobacteria. I develop two new metrics, selective signatures and slow:fast, for detecting deviations from the expected rate of evolution in 'core' proteins (present in single copy in most species). Because they rely on empirical distributions of evolutionary rates across species, these methods should become increasingly powerful as more and more microbial genomes are sampled.

We previously reported that ALDH1-high cases of uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma showed poor prognosis, and that ALDH1 high population was more tumorigenic, invasive, and resistant to apoptosis than ALDH1 low population. Histamine plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Here, we examined the effect of histamine on ALDH1 expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line. The addition of histamine increased ALDH1 high population, which was consistent with the result that histamine enhanced the invasive ability and the resistance to anticancer drug. Among 4 types of histamine receptors, histamine H1 and H2 receptor (H1R and H2R) were expressed in endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line. The addition of H1R agonist but not H2R agonist increased ALDH1. The antagonist H1R but not H2R inhibited the effect of histamine on ALDH1 expression. These results indicated that histamine increased the expression of ALDH1 via H1R but not H2R.

Nuclear eccentricity was also increased for the anisotropic tissues, suggesting that intracellular forces deform the nucleus as the cell is spatially confined. During systole, nuclei experienced increasing spatial confinement in magnitude and direction of displacement as tissue anisotropy increased, yielding anisotropic deformation. Thus, the nature of nuclear displacement and deformation during systole appears to rely on a combination of the passive myofibril spatial organization and the active stress fields induced by contraction. Such findings have implications in understanding the genomic consequences and functional response of cardiac myocytes to their ECM surroundings under conditions of disease."}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["sprague-dawley", "cell nucleus", "animals", "cell size", "biomedical engineering and bioengineering", "cells", "elastic modulus", "cultured", "myocytes", "newborn", "cellular", "cardiac", "rats", "tissue engineering", "mechanotransduction"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2014-11-19T21:50:19", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.cmu.edu/bme/103"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "National Academy of Sciences"}, "description": "The activated B-cell\u2013like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer that can only be cured in roughly 40% of cases.

For both research and clinical applications concurrent multimodality data collection plays an important role in understanding the signal sources. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are particularly interesting examples, in that each offers largely independent yet complementary information on neuronal activity. While we and others have made great strides in making concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings possible, the EEG data, in particular, still contain signal artifacts of cardiac origin (ballistocardiogram) that make EEG analysis difficult, or even impossible. To date, no satisfying means to separate brain EEG signal and ballistocardiogram (BCG) exist especially for non-event-related-potential experiments and under 3-T MR scanner. The BCG presents high temporal non-stationarity due to variation in cardiac cycles, and its amplitude scales with magnetic field strength. This explains the considerable variation of success levels among studies, with more successful applications achieved at lower field strength. Previously published methods used one of blind source separation methods to remove the BCG. All such blind source separation approaches are limited to performing component extraction based on the contaminated data alone, agnostic of the structural difference between BCG and EEG. Another kind of approach is to utilize reference signals for the artifact itself. However, this requires purpose-built hardware and exploits no further denoising step besides a simple subtraction.We have developed three algorithms to separate EEG signal and BCG artifacts. Firstly, we have designed a Direct Recording - Prior Encoding (DRPE) method to maximally incorporate prior knowledge of BCG/EEG subspaces described by bases learned from a modified recording configuration, and of the group sparsity characteristics in the signal. To further promote subspace separability, a Direct Recording Joint Incoherent Basis (DRJIB) method is proposed to learn a representative and sparse set of BCG and EEG bases by minimizing a cost function consisting of group sparsity penalties for automatic dimension selection and an energy term for encouraging incoherence. Reconstruction is subsequently obtained by fitting the contaminated data to a generative model using the learned bases subject to regularization. The third algorithm takes advantage of currently available high-density EEG cap, to reliably estimate the full-scalp BCG contribution from a near-optimal small subset (20 out of 256) of channels and a corresponding weight through our modified experimental setup using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). We show in carefully constructed simulations that the residual artifacts are reduced by several orders of magnitude to a tiny fraction of the true signal. In human studies we show that the methods work effectively, and validate our quantitative results. Beyond the application to the EEG-fMRI challenge, we expect that our algorithmic methods will have impact in many other domains where signal and contaminant have distinct information structures. Digital signal, imaging, or even financial data are also contaminated with noises so that studying and characterizing the information structures of desired and undesired signals would greatly improve the modeling power.", "contributors": [{"name": "XIA, HONGJING", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "XIA", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "HONGJING", "email": ""}], "title": "Ballistocardiogram (BCG) Removal for Continuous EEG Recordings inside a 3-T MR scanner", "shareProperties": {"source": "ucescholarship"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "dissertation"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["qt20z7n39x", "http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/20z7n39x", "http://n2t.net/ark:/13030/m5qr70ws", "qt20z7n39x"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": []}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "XIA, HONGJING.

A common feature of neurodegenerative diseases is progressive dysfunction and death of neurons in key regions of the brain. Observations of dysregulated cell cycle proteins in the brains of patients, along with research in animal models and cultured cells, suggest that aberrant functions of cell cycle proteins contribute to neuronal death and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.\nThe p53 tumor suppressor is a key component in cell cycle signaling and cell death. p53 maintains multiple functions related to cellular homeostasis and cell fate determination, and is negatively regulated by two E3 ubiquitin ligases, MDM2 and MDMX (murine double minute X). MDM2 and MDMX promote cell survival and are implicated in several types of cancer, but the functions of MDMX in neurons are largely unknown. MDMX promotes survival in cultured neurons, but becomes degraded in response to neurotoxic stress, leading to a conclusion that MDMX acts as a \u201cnode\u201d for stress factors in neuronal death.\nThis thesis examines mechanisms by which MDMX promotes neuronal survival, and how MDMX functions become disrupted during neurodegenerative disease. Utilizing human tissue samples, rodent models, and pharmacological experiments in cultured neurons, we determined how MDMX is affected in AD and HAND, and how these changes relate to neuronal damage. First, we demonstrate that calpain\u2013mediated loss of MDMX contributes to neuronal damage in a model of HAND, and that MDMX overexpression protects neurons in this model. In our second body of work, we demonstrate that neuronal MDMX is reduced in AD and in AD models due to amyloid\u2013induced caspase activation, and that loss of MDMX function contributes to pathological processes observed in AD, including mitochondrial damage, calpain activation, and Cdk5 hyperactivity. Finally, we examine p53 as a downstream effector of MDMX in neurons.\nWe conclude that the oncoprotein MDMX promotes neuronal survival through regulation of mitochondria, calpains, and Cdk5.

Several challenges such as the dynamic nature of cellular systems, uncertainty due to environmental influences, and the heterogeneity between individual patients render this a difficult task. In the last decade, several algorithms have been proposed to elucidate cellular systems from data, resulting in numerous data-driven hypotheses. However, due to the large number of variables involved in the process, many of which are unknown or not measurable, such computational approaches often lead to a high proportion of false positives. This renders interpretation of the data-driven hypotheses extremely difficult. Consequently, a dismal proportion of these hypotheses are subject to further experimental validation, eventually limiting their potential to augment existing biological knowledge. This dissertation develops a framework of computational methods for the analysis of such data-driven hypotheses leveraging existing biological knowledge.

Several challenges such as the dynamic nature of cellular systems, uncertainty due to environmental influences, and the heterogeneity between individual patients render this a difficult task. In the last decade, several algorithms have been proposed to elucidate cellular systems from data, resulting in numerous data-driven hypotheses. However, due to the large number of variables involved in the process, many of which are unknown or not measurable, such computational approaches often lead to a high proportion of false positives. This renders interpretation of the data-driven hypotheses extremely difficult. Consequently, a dismal proportion of these hypotheses are subject to further experimental validation, eventually limiting their potential to augment existing biological knowledge. This dissertation develops a framework of computational methods for the analysis of such data-driven hypotheses leveraging existing biological knowledge. Specifically, I show how biological knowledge can be mapped onto these hypotheses and subsequently augmented through novel hypotheses.

This study explores the structural features that enable Cas9 to bind and cleave target DNAs, and the results suggest a way of regulating Cas9 by physical separation of the catalytic domains from the rest of the protein scaffold.", "contributors": [{"name": "Wright, Addison V.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Wright", "additionalName": "V.", "givenName": "Addison", "email": ""}, {"name": "Sternberg, Samuel H.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Sternberg", "additionalName": "H.", "givenName": "Samuel", "email": ""}, {"name": "Taylor, David W.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Taylor", "additionalName": "W.", "givenName": "David", "email": ""}, {"name": "Staahl, Brett T.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Staahl", "additionalName": "T.", "givenName": "Brett", "email": ""}, {"name": "Bardales, Jorge A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Bardales", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Jorge", "email": ""}, {"name": "Kornfeld, Jack E.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Kornfeld", "additionalName": "E.", "givenName": "Jack", "email": ""}, {"name": "Doudna, Jennifer A.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Doudna", "additionalName": "A.", "givenName": "Jennifer", "email": ""}], "title": "Rational design of a split-Cas9 enzyme complex", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biological sciences"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-19T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364227"}}, {"publisher": {"name": "MyJove Corporation"}, "description": "Spermatogonial stem and progenitor cells (SSCs) of the testis represent a classic example of adult mammalian stem cells and preserve fertility for nearly the lifetime of the animal.

In comparison to these time-consuming approaches, we have recently found that combined inhibition of three signaling pathways, TGF\u03b2/SMAD2, BMP/SMAD1, and FGF/ERK, promotes rapid induction of neuroectoderm from hPSCs, followed by immediate differentiation into functional neurons. Here, we have adapted our procedure to a novel multititre plate format, to further enhance its reproducibility and to make it compatible with mid-throughput applications. It comprises four days of neuroectoderm formation in floating spheres (embryoid bodies), followed by a further four days of differentiation into neurons under adherent conditions. Most cells obtained with this protocol appear to be bipolar sensory neurons. Moreover, the procedure is highly efficient, does not require particular expert skills, and is based on a simple chemically defined medium with cost-efficient small molecules. Due to these features, the procedure may serve as a useful platform for further functional investigation as well as for cell-based screening approaches requiring human sensory neurons or neurons of any type.", "contributors": [{"name": "Zhang, Miao", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Zhang", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Miao", "email": ""}, {"name": "Sch\u00f6ler, Hans R.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Sch\u00f6ler", "additionalName": "R.", "givenName": "Hans", "email": ""}, {"name": "Greber, Boris", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Greber", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Boris", "email": ""}], "title": "Rapid and Efficient Generation of Neurons from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in a Multititre Plate Format", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["stem cell biology"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-05T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3622096"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Error backpropagation is an extremely effective algorithm for assigning\ncredit in artificial neural networks.

Researchers have long postulated that living organisms utilize the macromolecules of organic matrices to actively guide the formation of crystal structures. The timing and placement of the subsequent minerals that form are most easily controlled during nucleation; however, a physical and chemical picture of how organic functional group chemistry influences the initial stages of nucleation is not yet established. These processes are further complicated by the realization that carbonate biominerals can form by an amorphous to crystalline transformation process, which has prompted the question of how chemical signatures are recorded during mineralization.  Investigations of mineralization processes such as the kinetics of nucleation and the transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to crystalline products are critical to building a better understanding of biomineral formation.  Only from that fundamental basis can one begin to decipher changes in climate and seawater chemistry over geologic time and by recent anthropogenic effects.\n\nThis dissertation presents the findings from experimental studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of multiple mineral formation processes, including nucleation and transformation from an amorphous phase. The kinetics of calcite nucleation onto a suite of high-purity polysaccharide (PS) substrates were quantified under controlled conditions. Nucleation rates were measured as a function of 1) supersaturation extending above and below ACC solubility and 2) ionic strength extending to seawater salinity.  These conditions decipher the chemical interactions between the PS substrate, calcite crystal, and solution. These investigations show the energy barrier to calcite formation is regulated by competing interfacial energies between the substrate, crystal, and liquid.  The energy barriers to nucleation are PS-specific by a systematic relationship to PS charge density and substrate structure that is rooted in minimization of the competing substrate-crystal and substrate-liquid interfacial energies.  The data also suggest ionic strength regulates nucleation barriers through substrate-liquid and crystal-liquid interfacial energetics.\n\nIn a second experimental study, stable isotope labeling was used to directly probe the transformation pathway.  Four processes were considered: dissolution-reprecipitation, solid-state, or combinations of these end member processes. Isotope measurements of calcite crystals that transform from ACC have signatures that are best explained by dissolution-reprecipitation. The extent of isotopic mixing correlates with the amount of ACC transferred and the time to transformation, suggesting the calcite crystals are recording the changing local solution environment during the transformation.  These investigations into different mineralization mechanisms build a framework for how functional group chemistries of organic molecules regulate mineralization and the resulting isotopic and elemental signatures in the calcite.  This may provide useful insights to interpreting chemical signatures of carbonate biominerals in fossil record and understanding ocean chemistry changes throughout geologic time.", "contributors": [{"name": "Giuffre, Anthony J", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Giuffre", "additionalName": "J", "givenName": "Anthony", "email": ""}, {"name": "Geosciences", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Geosciences", "email": ""}, {"name": "Dove, Patricia M.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Dove", "additionalName": "M.", "givenName": "Patricia", "email": ""}, {"name": "Rimstidt, James D", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Rimstidt", "additionalName": "D", "givenName": "James", "email": ""}, {"name": "Hochella, Michael F", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Hochella", "additionalName": "F", "givenName": "Michael", "email": ""}, {"name": "De Yoreo, James J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "De Yoreo", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "James", "email": ""}, {"name": "Roman, Maren", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Roman", "additionalName": "", "givenName": "Maren", "email": ""}], "title": "Biomolecular Controls on Calcium Carbonate Formation by Amorphous and Classical Pathways: Insights from Measurements of Nucleation Rates and Isotope Tracers", "shareProperties": {"source": "vtech"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "Other - Dissertation"}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": []}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "ETD"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": ["2015-04-27T08:00:11Z", "2015-04-27T08:00:11Z", "2015-04-26"]}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["vt_gsexam:4803", "http://hdl.handle.net/10919/51821", "oai:vtechworks.lib.vt.edu:10919/51821"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["com_10919_5534", "col_10919_11041"]}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": "The authors of the theses and dissertations are the copyright owners.

The combined treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor and conventional photon radiation also showed more effective tumor growth delay than radiation alone. However, little is known regarding the combined treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor and heavy-ion irradiation. In this study, SQ5 human lung tumor cells were used in vitro for clonogenic cell survival and in vivo for tumor growth delay measurement using a mouse xenograft model after 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) pretreatment and carbon ion irradiation. Repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was also assessed along with expressions of DSB repair-related proteins. Cell cycle analysis after the combined treatment was also performed. The combined treatment of 17AAG and carbon ions revealed a promising treatment option in both in vitro and in vivo studies. One likely cause of this effectiveness was shown to be the inhibition of homologous recombination repair by 17AAG. The more intensified G2 cell cycle delay was also associated with the combined treatment when compared with carbon ion treatment alone.

It is likely that global\nclimatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant\nimpact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these\npatterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is\nparticularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we\nintegrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of\ntrophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited\nmammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during\nthe Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional\ncontribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the\nstructure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial\nMaximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe\ncommunities.

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1) regulates thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis and uracil accumulation in DNA, and as such affects genome stability. Previously, we showed that decreased SHMT1 expression in Shmt1 knockout mice (Shmt1\u2212/+) or its impaired nuclear localization, as occurs in mice over-expressing an Shmt1 transgene (Shmt1tg+), results in elevated uracil incorporation into DNA, which could affect colon cancer risk. We used these 2 models to determine the effect of altered SHMT1 expression and localization, and its interaction with folate insufficiency, on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer in mice. Shmt1\u2212/+ and Shmt1tg+ mice were weaned to a control or folate-and-choline-deficient (FCD) diet and fed the diet for 28 or 32 wk, respectively. At 6 wk of age, mice were injected weekly for 6 wk with 10 mg/kg AOM (w/v in saline). Colon uracil concentrations in nuclear DNA were elevated 2\u20137 fold in Shmt1\u2212/+ and Shmt1tg+ mice. However, colon tumor incidence and numbers were not dependent on SHMT1 expression in Shmt1\u2212/+ or Shmt1\u2212/\u2212 mice. The FCD diet reduced tumor load independent of Shmt1 genotype. In contrast, Shmt1tg+ mice exhibited a 30% reduction in tumor incidence, a 50% reduction in tumor number, and a 60% reduction in tumor load compared with wild-type mice independent of dietary folate intake. Our data indicate that uracil accumulation in DNA does not predict tumor number in AOM-mediated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, enrichment of SHMT1 in the cytoplasm, as observed in Shmt1tg+ mice, protects against AOM-mediated carcinogenesis independent of its role in nuclear de novo dTMP biosynthesis.", "contributors": [{"name": "MacFarlane, Amanda J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "MacFarlane", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "Amanda", "email": ""}, {"name": "McEntee, Michael F.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "McEntee", "additionalName": "F.", "givenName": "Michael", "email": ""}, {"name": "Stover, Patrick J.", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Stover", "additionalName": "J.", "givenName": "Patrick", "email": ""}], "title": "Azoxymethane-Induced Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice Occurs Independently of De Novo Thymidylate Synthesis Capacity123", "shareProperties": {"source": "pubmedcentral"}, "languages": [null], "subjects": ["biochemical", "molecular", "and genetic mechanisms"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-04-01T00:00:00", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083238"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Deep graph-theoretic ideas in the context with the graph of the World Wide\nWeb led to the definition of Google's PageRank and the subsequent rise of the\nmost-popular search engine to date.

Structural and diversity parameters (species richness, Shannon index, evenness) were measured for both insect orders and trophic guilds. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was applied to determine how vegetation parameters (species richness and cover) influence spatial and seasonal fluctuations of insect assemblages. The catches totalled 434 insect individuals classified into 75 species, 62 genera, 31 families and 7 orders, of which Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were the most abundant and constant over seasons and study stations. Spring and autumn presented the highest values of diversity parameters. Individual-based Chao-1 species richness estimator indicated 126 species for the total individuals captured in the Sabkha. Based on catch abundances, the structure of functional trophic groups was predators (37.3%), saprophages (26.7%), phytophages (20.5%), polyphages (10.8%), coprophages (4.6%); whereas in terms of numbers of species, they can be classified as phytophages (40%), predators (25.3%), polyphages (13.3%), saprophages (12%), coprophages (9.3%). The CCA demonstrated that phytophages and saprophages as well as Coleoptera and Orthoptera were positively correlated with the two parameters of vegetation, especially in spring and summer. While the abundance of coprophages was positively correlated with species richness of plants, polyphage density was positively associated with vegetation cover.

Though there exist several\ntools addressing these problems individually, the scientific community still\nlacks an environment that combines these three capabilities together. NaviCell\nis a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions,\ncreated in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and\nmaintenance. NaviCell combines three features: (1) efficient map browsing based\non Google Maps engine; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of\ndetails or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for\ncollecting the community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in\nthe field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of their\ninterest in the context of signaling pathways and cross-talks between pathways\nwithin a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed\nmolecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map\nup to a top-level modular representation.

Numerous transgenic strains expressing these fluorophores in specific neurons are readily available or can be constructed using well-established techniques.

We discuss advantages and disadvantages of both as well as various methods of sample preparation (animal immobilization) and image analysis. Finally, we present results from two experiments: 1) Using GCaMP to measure the sensory response of a specific neuron to an external electrical field and 2) Using cameleon to measure the physiological calcium response of a neuron to traumatic laser damage.

Understanding the complex EGFR regulatory network is critical for developing effective therapeutic interventions. To this end, this work investigated the functions of two incompletely characterized regulators of EGFR trafficking and signaling, mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) and Sprouty2 (SPRY2), in two cancer settings where EGFR mutation is common, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In NSCLC cells, results indicate that MIG6, an endogenous inhibitor of EGFR activity and endocytic adaptor, is surprisingly responsible for at least half of EGFR endocytosis, suggesting that a substantial fraction of internalized EGFR may not be competent to drive signaling. Computational modeling further suggested that in cells expressing kinase-activated, endocytosis-impaired EGFR mutants, the importance of MIG6 relative to other endocytic pathways is increased, but that MIG6 internalization capacity is reduced compared to cells expressing wild-type EGFR. Additional data indicate that SPRY2 expression reduces EGFR endocytosis rate primarily by promoting EGFR expression, which overwhelms the saturable EGFR endocytic pathway, but that SPRY2 also promotes ERK phosphorylation and resistance to EGFR inhibition independent of EGFR expression level. In GBM cell lines, our data demonstrate that SPRY2 expression promotes proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, resistance to EGFR and c-MET co-inhibition, and growth as mouse tumor xenografts. Additional studies identified SPRY2-mediated regulation of the strength and effects of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways as important for controlling GBM cell behaviors. Through analysis of public datasets and a collaborative analysis of human and rat tumors, we further found that elevated SPRY2 expression is associated with reduced patient survival and expression of EGFR variant III, an EGFR mutant linked to aggressive GBM. Thus, while SPRY2 is a candidate tumor suppressor in other contexts, our results support a tumor promoter role for SPRY2 in GBM and identify SPRY2 and the pathways it regulates as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for therapeutic response. Overall, these findings add new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the complexities of EGFR trafficking and signaling regulation and the functions of SPRY2 and MIG6 that may be leveraged to develop improved cancer therapies.", "contributors": [{"name": "Walsh, Alice Macdonald", "sameAs": [], "familyName": "Walsh", "additionalName": "Macdonald", "givenName": "Alice", "email": ""}], "title": "Regulation of cell signaling by MIG6 and Sprouty2 in cancers with EGFR mutations", "shareProperties": {"source": "upennsylvania"}, "otherProperties": [{"name": "type", "properties": {"type": "text"}}, {"name": "format", "properties": {"format": "application/pdf"}}, {"name": "date", "properties": {"date": "2014-01-01T08:00:00Z"}}, {"name": "identifier", "properties": {"identifier": ["http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1302", "http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2426&amp;context=edissertations", "oai:repository.upenn.edu:edissertations-2426"]}}, {"name": "setSpec", "properties": {"setSpec": ["publication:be", "publication:edissertations", "publication:seas"]}}, {"name": "source", "properties": {"source": "Publicly Accessible Penn Dissertations"}}, {"name": "rights", "properties": {"rights": []}}], "languages": [null], "subjects": ["cancer", "drug resistance", "feedback", "cell biology", "biomedical", "computational modeling", "signaling"], "providerUpdatedDateTime": "2015-03-16T19:01:32", "uris": {"canonicalUri": "http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/1302"}}, {"publisher": {"name": ""}, "description": "  Lifetime distributions of social entities, such as enterprises, products, and\nmedia contents, are one of the fundamental statistics characterizing the social\ndynamics.
